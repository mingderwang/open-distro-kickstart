Absolutely by the time he graduated from high school chuck was drinking heavily he kept drinking in college and then he dropped out of notre dame after eighteen months okay so far it's he's killing it\n\nspk_2 : yeah, the liver over\n\nspk_3 : the next two\n\nspk_1 : decades his drinking lost him several jobs and two wine\n\nspk_2 : drinking seems to be a theme we're starting in this one pretty early he's into it. Okay it's\n\nspk_1 : sort of his jam okay facing divorce from his second wife he went toe alcoholics anonymous and she left anyway okay sure he was forty three living in southern california and on unemployment he stayed sober but there was a lot he didn't like about a especially how they didn't allow drug users\n\nspk_2 : interesting tio have right? Yeah, it\n\nspk_3 : well, I mean, you know, it's mine early\n\nspk_2 : misleading I guess you like I don't know what drinking it is minor drugs have helped? Yeah,\n\nspk_1 : s a chuck went instead of his own group.\n\nspk_2 : Okay. On drinking drug hers? Yeah, it\n\nspk_1 : started in nineteen. Fifty eight in this seedy neighborhood in santa monica. Eleven people came regularly. Okay, they explored what? Shut called, quote, a line of no lines.\n\nspk_2 : I'm going to need youto help a little. They're\n\nspk_1 : basically they attacked each other, calling out those they thought were lying or egotistical. So it's, just like a verbal assault on someone just like weekly argument tearing someone down. Think like a comedy roast, but really not fun,\n\nspk_2 : right? Ok, so they had a monty python sketch once a week.\n\nspk_1 : It wasn't like a back and forth. You would just sit there, and then everyone would just fucking rip into you\n\nspk_2 : and you. And that was and it was viewed it's. Therapeutic? Yes. Okay. Right, people. I wasn't sure if they were planning on having, like, a good meeting and then it all turned into, like, a dressing down.\n\nspk_1 : No, no it's just being mean to someone,\n\nspk_2 : okay? Interesting. Mom and I have meaning eight.\n\nspk_3 : I have to go\n\nspk_2 : to me. They have my meeting.\n\nspk_1 : The regulars loved it. They thought I was fucking great. Sure, word got out, mailman. Word got out. More people came, ah lot of heroin addicts who heard one member kick heroin in the program. Chuck called the group the tender loving care club. What one day a member it was saying they should do a seminar and chuck thought they said sin in on what is a synonym well that's not a word\n\nspk_2 : okay okay it was it sounds a jewish jason\n\nspk_1 : s o then he changed the name to send it on so he did like the the like the word scramble ok so new name now it's not tender loving care it's senator oh yeah okay in the\n\nspk_3 : early\n\nspk_1 : days he were reportedly coined the phrase quote this is the first day of the rest of your life\n\nspk_3 : well that's a\n\nspk_2 : big one you know that one don't absolute yes ideo I mean i've i've i've said it's head itself a lot here a couple of laws last a lot a lot you have said it to myself I say to myself a lot I say it's about half look I have to say to myself in the mirror before I leave okay it's become a bit of a tick morning morning I have to go to the mirror\n\nspk_1 : okay bye andi came up with a new form of group therapy called the haircut so this is what it is it's what we talked about members usually knew had let every member tell them what they're false were so new guy comes in and then they just sit there and just fucking grip\n\nspk_2 : and ripping them just off of not no no knowledge\n\nspk_1 : probably I guess the guy would probably share about himself. And then they were just fucking let the guy have. Okay? Sounds good. Everyone would rip into the member. One person described it as, quote, brutal, but on a verbal level.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, sure. Yeah. Yeah. So it is it's like\n\nspk_1 : my dad. So, yeah, it is full. Assume this became known as the game. This is really weird. One member would talk about that himself and then be brutally criticized by the other members. Were encouraged to be critical of everything. But when outside the game, everyone was supposed to be super nice to each other and no violence.\n\nspk_2 : This is the verbal fight club. Yeah, yeah, you did. You have these meetings where you just all out attack in terror than out of there? You're like. Well, yeah, I just don't want to\n\nspk_3 : love you, jimmy.\n\nspk_1 : And then you hug in whatever.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, but then you think back on it you're like, wait a minute. I wasn't sharing a drink with anyone. I was awful was me in the parking lot alone.\n\nspk_1 : Oh, my god,\n\nspk_2 : I handed to\n\nspk_1 : who bombed that place. All right when the cat's done\n\nspk_0 : on the move\n\nspk_3 : sittinon\n\nspk_1 : grew to twenty people in its first year chuck leads to run down storefront and move the meetings there and then he incorporated senator okay now it's a corporation share as it's supposed to be absolute it hit fifty members in the second year it's growth comes coming on chuck stop funding it with his unemployment checks finding financial supporters and pushing sober members to get jobs and then give their entire paycheck to sin on\n\nspk_2 : well this is I mean this is fast right yeah\n\nspk_1 : I mean in under two years pretty quick\n\nspk_2 : yeah it's already building your empire\n\nspk_1 : eso this became standard for all members\n\nspk_2 : so you are just giving the senate on all your money we're sitting on all your money yeah okay they\n\nspk_1 : moved to a beach house\n\nspk_2 : like this sort of like you know like the summer season\n\nspk_1 : except people didn't like the idea of drug addicts being around that's interesting eso locals wanted cited for violating zoning laws okay and while local papers were critical bigger papers like the times wrote favorable stories okay the combo of helping outcasts and fighting the establishment made hollywood liberals jump on board\n\nspk_2 : of stars like she's you know we don't give enough lip service tow how dumb hollywood you know for two people who live in it and you know coming to really don't weigh when we obviously like have like you know, like we're more liberally minded, but keep in mind I mean, we this town is just fact, lewis. Idiot. When you hear that, it is so easy to believe that just a bunch of like people are just like, well, I can't believe they're trying to kick him out of the beach community. Come on, becky, we're joining, I mean, let's, give him a million dollars it's\n\nspk_3 : all going to sit on\n\nspk_1 : its yeah, totally. One hundred percent right stars like jane fonda and leonard nimoy. We're guests sitting on assume there was after here. Yeah, soon there was a sin on the\n\nspk_3 : movie, got dummy years.

Yeah it's a big note i'm saying okay it's a large note\n\nspk_1 : but that was okay with chuck because his rehab program didn't work only ten percent of people stayed clean most abysmal that's not good both attics let left in less\n\nspk_2 : than a year people air going back than normal\n\nspk_1 : yeah yeah it's not great\n\nspk_3 : check it been\n\nspk_1 : graduating addicts after a year or two but he stopped now they had to stay forever.\n\nspk_2 : This is all really weird these air weird adjustments\n\nspk_1 : well, if they're if they're if they're making you not do that any more than the ones you have you have to keep right\n\nspk_3 : I don't know because\n\nspk_1 : you're making money off of them.

But this is where, when you're when you're introducing like schools and think that's, when it's a problem. And, I think it's weird. Yeah, when you're creating a new generation, that's a problem?\n\nspk_1 : Well, this is when senate on became known as sin, and on to there are now thought this equal the second sin and don't help me double sins. No in the sequel, that's. I just\n\nspk_2 : we had it a minute ago.\n\nspk_1 : They were now five thousand members. Branches were opening all over. Chuck. Chuck wanted to cut loose, be not completely devoted. His first targets were the ex drug addicts this's just because they complained\n\nspk_2 : a lot this is I mean this is how you run the cult offense yeah you mean it's pro labor is this is some fucking shit right here but that's what it was all about you're just not working out I can't trust you your ironic out we're trying to quit drugs yes and not here though\n\nspk_1 : we didn't do it like that so he started holding marathon game sessions that lasted seventy two straight hours or\n\nspk_2 : longer sessions being the dressing down yeah we just fucking\n\nspk_1 : hammer people members were delirious and broken down at the end older members would drop out once they were given time to sleep and reflect on what had happened the marathon sessions also became a way to indoctrinate new members so that's the that's the classic cult sleep deprivation thing the main sitting on compound was built in tamales bay rickards dressed just like chuck\n\nspk_2 : it's normal denim over okay I was going to say does he changes outfit every day but now he insists yes yeah good luck\n\nspk_3 : come on eileen no\n\nspk_1 : so you so it's dixie midnight runner since what we have here\n\nspk_3 : oh that's where those heads and they play they get the fiddle\n\nspk_1 : it's coming and they played the game three times a week three weeks a month on the fourth week they marathon for forty eight hours straight children played the game they started when they turned for\n\nspk_3 : god money generation of ass oh my god oh god\n\nspk_1 : the games became more vicious during one game they belittle the woman who was dying of cancer\n\nspk_3 : god what is going on?\n\nspk_1 : A member said to her quote you don't even deserve to have cancer\n\nspk_3 : I think that that is I think she went so far in one direction that she actually said something sweet\n\nspk_1 : I don't thinkit's thing you don't deserve\n\nspk_2 : I would say that to someone\n\nspk_1 : I think what he's saying in a bad way like you are not I good enough to have cancer\n\nspk_2 : I agree he is saying that but it comes out swinging so far so hard that he's actually potentially\n\nspk_1 : comes around to the side yeah it's the response is\n\nspk_2 : thank you and also like taking it terribly yeah you know but what he says quotas you don't deserve cancer well thank you\n\nspk_1 : so chuck diedrich was now super into himself that's shocking every sin on branch had a hang portrait's of chucking his wife betty old timers had to hang the pictures of the of them in their homes check was said to be incredibly charismatic and funny which is how he got away with all of this he certainly wasn't good looking he had a droopy eye and a booming voice\n\nspk_2 : I mean,\n\nspk_1 : he wants a look at my pi read this he wants opened a graduation ceremony by dropping his pants and exposing himself and\n\nspk_3 : then said he had revealed, quote, the last mystery of sin in off wait.

Oh, jesus chucks doctor told them they had to stop smoking, so he ordered no one that sittin on, could smoke that's, a terrible that's, unfair that's, totally where you go with this? No. So this was a nightmare, because cigarettes and coffee were like the fuel of senator\n\nspk_2 : you'd also like, I mean, a a like that it's that's,\n\nspk_1 : where it came from, that's. What it is like\n\nspk_2 : the amount of coffee and cigarettes,\n\nspk_1 : it's fucking ex addicts, extremely that's, their jam. So they smoke so much that the north carolina tobacco company had donated two hundred fifty thousand worth of cigarettes but now they had to send them all back seventy five members left immediately\n\nspk_2 : wow that really is testing how addictive nicotine is I mean seventy five people yeah they probably tried for like two hours okay that's good but you know what actually reasons on target anything\n\nspk_3 : I got up when I was like I could use a coffee and now i'm leaving\n\nspk_2 : i'm in my car and a bunch of coffees but I think if I wait an hour two hours I think that'll subside yeah then I won't have the craving anymore\n\nspk_3 : are you leaving I need call absolute\n\nspk_2 : i'm going out for cops believe i'd love to go yes let's leave let's leave here by entirely leave here\n\nspk_1 : we're going to a coffee place\n\nspk_3 : yeah we'll return the cigarettes\n\nspk_1 : theun mohr left due to how chuck and the elders handled members being upset about the smoking ban\n\nspk_2 : smoking created quite a ripple\n\nspk_1 : um these people were called out in the games publicly okay they were all going through\n\nspk_2 : withdrawal you not want to have a cigarette\n\nspk_1 : well now the think of the game so the game is people going through cigarette withdrawal and coffee withdrawal which is the thing on now they're playing a vicious game of attack\n\nspk_2 : the other got wet the beads of sweat\n\nspk_1 : at the peak of the smoking ban madness during a game one. Member challenge another to shave his head, and he did it. Okay. And then the challenger shaved his head. So here everyone started being challenged to shave their head. Chuck's right hand man that shaved his head and pushed others to doing it, saying it was a real quote slap in the face of middle class vanity.\n\nspk_2 : Yes, but they don't.

What a great!\n\nspk_3 : So he'd get on the\n\nspk_1 : mic, and he'd ramble about simmons philosophy and the future of sin. In on, if you miss the speech, you could go to a listening station in any of the any of the branches. Since the beginning, chuck had recorded every game he played in every meeting. He went, teo, every speech he made.\n\nspk_2 : He's. Like now. He's like sliver.\n\nspk_1 : Even now, what? But you could now go and to the listening stations. Just here is back catalogue\n\nspk_2 : of all the dread of all the\n\nspk_1 : whole back chuck. Amazingly, things started getting\n\nspk_2 : dark, weird, weird didn't feel like that was gonna happen\n\nspk_1 : during the game. One day, a woman kept interrupting chuck's wife,\n\nspk_2 : oh boy,\n\nspk_1 : chuck, then got into a heated argument with a woman and then poured a can of root beer on her head. This broke the cardinal rule of absolutely no violence against others, especially during the game. When confronted about it later, chuck had a great excuse, quote. It was to teach her a lesson\n\nspk_3 : and kind of funny,\n\nspk_1 : and, yeah, I was running point of root beer on a lady's.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, okay, I do like the standard of violence, because the rest of you, but I, yeah,\n\nspk_1 : but you're not supposed to, like, do anything you're supposed to be supposed to be verbal,\n\nspk_2 : right, I get that\n\nspk_1 : that's, not verbal.

So everyone has to ride a motorcycle but not everyone knew how to ride a motorcycle\n\nspk_3 : and that I mean this really is like what? The brashness of cults\n\nspk_1 : no one was trained to ride, so they just get on.\n\nspk_3 : You just pick up on the fly. Well,\n\nspk_2 : I started it in time.\n\nspk_1 : Chuck implored members to ride anyway. One old timer died and several others lost limbs lost wow in rome and rex what? The deejay in charge of the in house radio station lost a leg in a crash.\n\nspk_2 : Hey, everybody, welcome back on the ones and twos, not playing it like I used to. Actually, when you look at my limbs now, it is a two and one situation. They're coming in the morning. Ladies and gentlemen, traffic out there is a nightmare based on the new harley edict, people air crashing into each other.

It's me happened the morning let's go.\n\nspk_1 : Check became or tyrannical\n\nspk_2 : good we're gonna call your tyrannical either way but I still think after aah harley addict you mean I\n\nspk_3 : think that's a sign that you're headed\n\nspk_2 : that way yeah\n\nspk_1 : members were now being viciously game for miss speaking in public are not making their bets this is when his\n\nspk_2 : doctor almost like human twitter\n\nspk_1 : oh my god it is it is human twitter it's totally human twitter members were now being viciously getting I did that when his doctors told him he need to exercise more chuck announce a new programme called the fat a thon\n\nspk_2 : dave don't stop\n\nspk_3 : what's the fat well required all members to spend a portion\n\nspk_1 : of the day jogging in\n\nspk_3 : place so because s so basically\n\nspk_2 : he is just has a bunch of virtual hymns yeah whenever anything as they must do immediately after yeah\n\nspk_1 : it's almost like a voodoo doll like anything happens to that. Yeah and one woman refused to participate in the fat a thon interesting and was public about it. So chuck brought him here. Chuck brought it to the cafeteria and made her jog in front of everyone as they ate checks, checks a normal kind of normal guy\n\nspk_2 : had a chill sort of dude coming.\n\nspk_3 : Did this all start for him when he was how old\n\nspk_1 : on his forty three.\n\nspk_2 : When when this really took through it?\n\nspk_1 : Well, when he started when he started it right that\n\nspk_3 : I was going to say you could blame it\n\nspk_2 : on early success. No, no, this is now he's, almost it's, almost like he's. Kanye, a little bit.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, he's. Super fucked up. So after you made this woman jogging place, the woman told other members that she wanted to quit, but she couldn't, because it would mean leaving her husband and two kids. It sent it on, so this is really common. It sent it on one spouse wants to leave, yeah, once passed, wants to leave. The kids were there because they've got all the kids in the other place, and the kids were like being raised by everybody coming way.\n\nspk_2 : We can't go. We must stay at caen in on three that's, right\n\nspk_1 : in sin, in on three, chuck's off something new, he told his followers he wanted sittin on to be the vanguard of aggressive, militant religions\n\nspk_3 : god.

Does a child mean value or is it just kind of a lark? Do you think there is any appreciable difference between a person who moves their bowels several times a day and those once a day?\n\nspk_2 : What is going on? Teo on the radio you like\n\nspk_3 : that you know\n\nspk_1 : do you really and truly think that this natural process has any effect on the person doing it I mean\n\nspk_3 : what are you going to get out of\n\nspk_1 : that baby I understand it's like crapping a football more than anything else what\n\nspk_3 : do you want\n\nspk_1 : to do that for for christ sake jesus and then he called sin on children a big issue because quote every baby that we indulge a sitting on female takes up a bed and somewhere between one hundred and two hundred thousand dollars were worth of energy so they're too expensive is what he said in seventeen years one hundred fifty children have been born it sent it on now chuck was going to quote control births like wealthy people in the world have always done pardon he\n\nspk_3 : ordered the men to\n\nspk_2 : guess he think the wealthier doing he\n\nspk_3 : ordered the\n\nspk_1 : men to get vasectomies on pregnant pregnant women to get abortions within five days or they'd be kicked out oh my god hundreds of members then left\n\nspk_2 : yeah okay and started smoking as soon oh god it's like yeah oh yeah get\n\nspk_1 : these fucking overalls\n\nspk_2 : off i'm gonna keep wearing mine yeah but\n\nspk_3 : this is what\n\nspk_1 : chuck wanted because he was calling this the squeeze he wanted to push his many members out and leave on ly the very most devoted so ok yeah.

They\n\nspk_1 : had to live in tents and dig their own toilets, sure, but they were rescued by one of synonyms, richard's supporters, whose nicknamed the harris. She called out chuck during a game, and then he just blamed it on other members and shut it down.\n\nspk_2 : Wait, okay,\n\nspk_3 : so so she's, someone with money, he\n\nspk_2 : s o, right. He had to scapegoat in order to preserve the financial valve, so he was just basically like, I can't\n\nspk_3 : believe what they put you up to game's over.

Yeah, but for booking, for being such a small venue, we could get in a lot more. In this, a lot of people in pittsburgh couldn't come. Can you guys all quickly? Oh, ah, at my agent. Fuck you, josh! Okay, good where's the beer. So there's, no beer and it's a small bit. Alright, let's, get a job here. Okay, and we have all the beer. Now I know how fucked up this is. I want to thank jill vine, who might be here for helping me out with tonight's topic research. Yes. Seven, nineteen, eighteen forty nine. There's. One river. Well, there's got to be more to that in this story. Okay, is a river in this story? Then go fuck itself? Is that what it's called in pittsburgh? It should be called bank, called you go down that they go fuck yourself, henry clay frick. Finally, finally, we're finally doing this one. Yeah, I was born in west overton, pennsylvania. His grandfather ran a successful whiskey distillery and was the wealthiest man in the county. Alright, yeah, it's got freak, you money. Hot start. Other than providing a small cottage and a few acres of bad land on his estate, henry's grandfather shared. None of his wealth was with his daughter or her family. It would just be like, can you imagine having an abundance of something? And then people being around you that are close to you, not being able to have any of it. So you're just sort of sitting there while you have a ton of stuff. And then the people that you care about that have done so much to help you there, there, there, and you're just, meanwhile, sort of distracting yourself with a thing. I mean, I mean, for god's sake, what are you gonna die with all of it? You're not gonna have all that your life, mr. Crispier is so good. It's. Not bad. But hey did serve as a role model for his grandson, henry. At an early age, he became determined to have a larger fortune than his grandfather. Ok, good that's, what we're healthy it's mine of also, then, because henry's father john was not successful at all. He failed as a painter and struggled as a farmer. Well, it skips a generation. I think we've all heard that it's, one of those, henry, was considered a considered a fragile boy. He was skinny, underweight and delicate is a delicate, just seems like it's. An opinion, delicate, doesn't seem like it, like no doctors, like he suffers from being delicate. He, i'm gonna start up here so your son is delicate, watty. Say she suffers from what we call being a pussy. Your boy is a huge medical term, used to be called being a nancy. Yes, but then you know what happened. We found out that that wasn't right. So now we've labeled into something not offensive, he's. Good, though he's, not a fucking pussy, he's, just a pussy, but if we don't act quickly, he could be a fucking pussy, henry fell often. Wait, okay, so he really it's, just like. Henry I like what I see. So he's, like sam jackson and unbreakable yes, the opposite of bruce willis, is unbreakable one. But a boy is a boy, but if he falls down the subway stairs, he breaks everything that's, right. Okay, compared to the children, other children hey grew very slow, okay, what does this seat? Okay? And when he did grow, it caused him a great deal of pain. Oh, what's going on? Or i'm getting bigger again.\n\nspk_0 : No, henry, you can\n\nspk_1 : be a full moon out tonight, mama, look at my shoes. I don't want you going. You're gonna end up being six feet tall. No, don't say that i'll pop through the house like alice. Uh, when henry was six on the trip this season. Five and he's whining about rights. Bad news, son, right. Does it stop? One hundred six. On a trip to see his grandfather, he came down with scarlet fever. Okay, because, yeah, he died. Yeah, that's. The should be the end. Yeah, which most most children do not survive at the time. But somehow, henry did. I bet he wouldn't shut up the whole time, though, if growing hurt. Scarlet fever, is it? Henry also had, quote, chronic indigestion or in fluent inflammatory rheumatism. Wait, okay, rheumatism like it doesn't, yeah, it's, the joints, right, so he's, like he's, got like a child. I can't have any itis I sear my elbow crack he's got like he's got like that common childhood arthritis, you know for sure, are we sure, there's, not like a little seventy year old living in his chest. So that would mean he would have attacks. When he was highly stressed, he would come home and collapse onto the sofa. He would be, quote, suffering grievously, henry was given prescribed restorative sze, which would bring him relief. So, yeah, cocaine, heroin. How is that not going to bring you relief? I mean, good for may, awaken. I could go for some heroin. Wouldn't trump easier if you're on heroin? Yeah, henry went to pittsburgh and landed a job at a department store and vowed to become a millionaire by the time he turned thirty. Like, just stick to the shelves. Asshole. We don't need my job in a department store. Excuse me, these don't fit. Okay, here you go. Yeah, large over here, much better. I'm growing, you see, been there. No. Hey was very good at his job. His employer commended him, particularly on a success in quote, waiting upon lady customers. Okay, yeah, for sure. I think especially in this time, we're like, I don't like it. I, uh, well, what does he do, dave what's, this little angle let's. See where kit, I didn't get anything else. That's it, he's, just like good with the lady, customary to give a little eye contact and maybe. You don't know what that's it he looked at them, bring them to orgasm. I don't know how department stores work. I've never I don't care, but i'm not jacking anyone off. They're working on everything else. What kind of shoes do you want, sir, i'm actually not here for shoes. I just use the bathroom, but don't stop who to my first job, a great hand, for better with the ladies. Oh, no, it hurts, i'm growing. In eighteen sixty nine, he caught typhoid jesus, this kid's rell. I mean, for the guys, wind after growing he's, really getting like some haymakers thrown his way. It was considered a death sentence at the time, but once again, henry survived, okay after his grandfather hired him to do bookkeeping at the distillery. But a few months later, his grandfather died. Okay, henry was left nothing in the will as stipulated, but he had a cousin in the coke business in the coke business and the cocaine business. No it's, different kind of coke, coca cola business know. What are you talk, do it that way. Coke is a fuel that is made by baking. A soft coal in a furnace is okay, because at the beginning, it still sounded like, okay. Okay. For sure is a fuel. Ok? Okay. It has a high carbon content in a few impurity. Wait and what? It has a high carbon content and the last few impurity in few impurities. Okay, so henry believe coke had a lucrative future. And with four other man, he went into the coat business. I did it this way on purpose. Okay? He owned twenty percent. They had three hundred acres of coal and fifty coke ovens. Okay. But henry wanted by all the coal and all the coke ovens. Possible. That's. What coke's like. Way should get it all let's. Just get all of it. No, we'll figure it out. We'll just get all of it right now. Do it, man. That sounds so he got longs from thomas mellon famous banker dish bag. So thomas mellon was like your idea's great, just they're giving him cash toe to buy up as much coal and coke ovens as he could. And then the financial panic of eighteen, seventy three came and the price of coke plummeted. So all those partners were like, this is a bad fucking idea, so he bought their shares. Okay, andi just aren't buying up. All the other people are panicked about the business. Okay, on. This is all being bankrolled by melon. Lone's share its melon money, melon, money him and his money from henry. New steel. You're going to give up on the coke and get involved in the mill in game, honey, do our honey, don't, I will not. No, no, no, no way. Way! Come on, honey, honey, no! And her new steel was thie key product in industrial development. And coke was the key ingredient for making steel okay. In eighteen, seventy seven, there was a railroad strike that affected shipments of coke and coal. So henry and a sheriff went to evict a striker who lived on henry's property. It's so close to coca cola. Okay, the striker refused to leave, so henry and the deputy picked him up and threw him down an embankment into a creek. Is that ok to dio? Don't think it was going to say that. That's not treating manuel, right? Yeah. Then they threw all his belongings at him. That's. Nice that's. A better touch. Turns out henry frick was not fond of laborers. Interesting. Sure, that won't come back to be a factor in this. So when he turned thirty, as was his goal, he had become millionaire. Awesome. Yeah. Great. What a great story. A great story to be. Seventeen to be like, I want to be a millionaire and then you thirty and you are you're a fucking psycho path millionaire. Yeah, well, especially a thirty because that's like a third of the way through your life. They're like more than half of the way through your life. At this point, you know you're gonna be a real prick yet. Hey, solely owned h c fricking company, he employed a thousand workers and controlled eighty percent of the coal output in pennsylvania. Okay? Monopoly, which is awesome. It's a fun game. We love monopoly. I love the game, it's fun. In eighteen seventy nine, henry was one of a number of very rich pennsylvania money. Men who formed a secret club. Shit. Terrible news. It was called the south fork fishing and hunting club on a weird secret club let's show it to make of these people you guys know about the secret part you're clapping a lot it's not remember your oath they borrow blood by a fire for god's sake they bought land above john johnstown okay it had a large lake that was created by a dam all right it's artificial lecture the dam was originally reservoir the club was the place for rich men in the area to enjoy all the wealth it accumulated cool they picnic congress yeah they picnic they swam and fish sink cigars that relax homeboy so this was said to be the loreal catch me if you can vibe it really does said to be the largest artificial body of water in the world they modified the lake they put a fish screen across the spillway so the fish couldn't get out and then that would click debris which kind of makes a spillway not a spillway and they lowered the dam to build a road to make it more convenient for people going from the railroad station to the continent colleges on the lake so it was the easiest way to get across what that feels like a timeshare so far yeah no it's good so this is just this fun place that he goes to vacation yeah sure hey married adelaide child's in december eighteen eighty one she was thirty one he was twenty two. That's it celebrate normal? Yeah. They have four kids to it who would live, you know, more than a couple days. Standard. That's. A good ratio. Fifty percent it's. Great, yeah, for sure. No. And now andrew carnegie was another insanely rich man melon, mild boy. He owned carnegie steel, which was making one million five hundred thousand year, which today would be thirty seven million. Okay, a lot, uh people loved carnegie hey was from scotland. But his thorough americanization and enthusiastic patriot patriotism earned him the nickname the star spangled scotsman. That's. A dynamite image right there. God bless this mess. Right, because, my boy, these fucking colors, dorin! That's. Right, that's. Exactly right.\n\nspk_0 : Um, in the bloody coach dedication, you go\n\nspk_1 : batty. You pushed it. One of carnegie's managers named captain jones, whose job is to reduce costs. He came up with the eight hour work day in the steel industry because he controversially just go get away from that don't worry, he discovered he found workers could work at a high pace for eight hours and then be ready to go again if they got sixteen hours rest e I don't think he's right? No actually it's the other way around I think people can go for sixteen if you give him, like, four hours or as something around there. Yeah, yeah. So carnegie went from a twelve hour workday to an eight hour work day and everyone celebrated it, not realizing the reason he did it was because he's a fucking asshole. So carnegie formed a business relationship with henry, and soon hc frickin company was the exclusive coke supplier for all of carnegie's steel works. Okay? And carnegie bought carnegie bought stock in hc freak until you own half. So the two men did not really like each other. And yet carnegie bought half of yeah that's a good business to be in, right? Okay, but they don't really like carnegie loved the limelight and he preached about the rights of labour, which henry hated and henry lack humor was ignorant of literature, science or any region outside of the fucking my hunger valley hey, mahane, hong taylor, mo dong a lot. My long, long along. So you're all yelling at once. That's not going to do you monongahela. It sounds like it sounds a little bit like you're singing rubber biscuit manana. Mama got a home a home of e mei mei mei mei mei mei mei mei mei mei mei mei hey, do that again. I'll bow, bow. Uh, you have heard of a wish sandwich. Carnegie also thought henry was very socially uninterested. Okay, well, yeah, because he's like a bone whiner. No. Will you grant me some of that chex mix door, you fucking bone whiner. Oh, to shrink. Charles schwab said, said henry, was, quote, this is like a real who's. Who? I'm czech schwab, charles schwab said. Henry was, quote, a curious and puzzling man. No man on earth could get close to him or fathom him. He seemed more like a machine without emotion or impulse, absolutely cold blooded. No one could fathom him. I can't wrap my head around this guy unfathomable. Gentlemen, this is my friend, the machine, yellow tao. I like coke. So carnegie's brother tom died, and then carnegie allowed henry to by eleven per cent of stock and carnegie steel because made him chairman of the board, and he was made president, carnegie wrote to henry, quote, take supreme care of that head of yours. It is wanted again, expressing my thankfulness that I found the man. I'm always yours, a see what is going on, what these guys are going to fuck that's, okay, that's. What I was hoping it was going that way. Carnegie there's one bone that doesn't hurt when it grows. Get over here, you lump let's, just let's. Just say it, it's, not it's, not in here. It hasn't been written in your own history was clearly true that carnegie pegged henry frick. Cleveland and he pegged him because he couldn't get hard on himself, so he put on on may thirty first. That is weird. May thirty first, eighteen, eighty nine at four p, m. After a high snowmelt and ten days of heavy rainfall, the dam at the south fork fishing and hunting club collapsed. Okay, twenty million tons of water were released. Shit it's, not a little bit and it's a lot, you know, a little water, a sixty foot wall, sixty foot high wall of water. Okay, so we're really talking about an increase. That's. Yeah, compared to nothing, right? Yeah. Moving forty miles an hour, she rush down and crushed the town of johnstone. Okay, fourteen hundred buildings were destroyed, debris built up against a stone bridge, including several tanks of oil and fuel, which then burst into flames. Can I just ask real quick that you? Sure, these numbers aren't made up for political reasons? I'm going to need to see the bodies that's fair. Well, bring them by. Thank you. Eighty people were burnt alive. Oh, she eighty people were burnt life during a flood. Yeah, anybody could. Do you think you're going to go on drowned? Why my fire it's a river water, hurry, not there. Don't get up on the house! Oh, god! The fire burned for five days. What the flood killed two thousand two hundred nine people. Holy shit. Ten percent of the town's population. Bodies were found as far away as cincinnati. Which is four hundred miles away it's. Quite a serf. And yet, fishing that summer was great. In cincinnati, we got another big human fish boy that biden is that a sturgeon horrible bob, the farmer, oh boy, sturgeon are freshwater fish, so I fucked that up. Yeah, no, i'm just one percent of the audience was like, what is he talking about now, there's, some fishing asshole out here. It was like, what the fuck is, is good. Well, if this dude came for fishing, humor, he's got a negative attitude, and I don't like it sturgeon in a lake. Now i'm last. Get the hell out of here! So the south fork fishing and hunting club formed a committee to help the flood victims right on time. It was called the prince pittsburgh relief committee. Okay, a same time, they made a pact to never speak publicly about the club or the flood. Why is it that was that have to be on the deal that feels like you're trying to help, right? Nope. Okay, henry and carnegies companies donated fifteen thousand dollars to the relief fund, and what that's nice and the south fork fishing and hunting club donated three thousand dollars. Altogether eighteen thousand that'll do it. The costs and damages was over seventeen million, right? Right. So, yeah, it's, a great start. What do you want? Do you want to piss on him? Are getting a little bit of money on it. Give him some money or piss on him, if the money, while pissing on him some. Love rich. Oh, my god! We killed so many people. Where should we put a new club? So people sued the club. Because what grounds? These peasants, they grift, id together enough coppers to get a lawyer some time shop attorney. Left, I mean to over two thousand people died. Will move. We donated seventeen thousand dollars. Two of my babies died. I didn't sue my wife. This is a tsunami. Thank you, sir. The fuck out of here! You'll catch a sturgeon. So a couple of the club members just haven't I happen to be lawyers, and so they fought all the lawsuits. The club claimed they only lowered the damn by one foot when they built the road, okay, and that the flood was an act of god. Well, that should hold up. Yeah, that would hold up now. Yeah, all the people who sued lost this cause, some of them to go bankrupt. Henry carnegie and the other rich men got off scot free. Yeah, fuck, yeah! Finally, finally, little guy's not get one over this guy. No way, no it's, try little guy. The henry's life wasn't perfect. His daughter, martha, had been ill since she was two. Oh, my god! Imagine her illness became chronic, and no one knew what was causing it. But he's got all the money in the world. She's taken all the doctors. No one can figure this out revelled in this time. Yeah, yeah, like I don't know, she's hot. She has a dragon in her stomach and healers at it out, i'd be tried putting tons of beetles in her mouth. Yes, we will fill it with beetles, and that will eat the infection inside of your daughter. After that, we're gonna have to drown her. It's. A long shot. So when she was for a nurse, noticed a small wound on martha's right side that was oozing puss, wait, how so? Okay, is that new, or is that okay? So okay, so she's just leaking she's leaking she's got a valve. Should leaking, girl write what happens? Sure, yeah, you just all of a sudden have a little go hole, you leak. Sometimes spring assure you just have a little opening that's, possibly coming. Get aside aside, i've had you decide lee. No, no, yeah, you're like a box of wine. I get it. And then she let close on dh. She found a pin coming through the wound. Okay, this is now taking a weird turn. Well, when you say, okay, welcome to witchcraft. Martha, it turns out, had swallowed a pin when she was two years old. And it's slowly worked its way through her body. Shut up! Shut! Two years, nothing. A trail of destruction. And then ben, like, i'm going out the side. Is that true? Yeah, no that's, true that's. What happened? She swallowed a pin and she's a whore. She was touring the one she's, a fucking idiot! Number one, she's, a fucking idiot! Number two, they didn't have x rays, so that thing is wound its way, just like I assume, just like poking through like it's a needle. So it's just going cruise and I don't like cross stitched a little on the way, not a cross stitch. My handsome cross stitches on july twenty ninth, eighteen, ninety one, she died before her sixth birthday, henry was devastated like a good capitalist. He put her likeness on his checks. Just perfect, man. Wait your a fucking monster. No. If you put if your daughter dies, we're like, well, what's, the best way I can remember finally values. What about what? I pay people money so they can all see my daughter. I'm a capitalist. Money, money, money, money, you know. So that made me feel less sorry for him. Plus, he just killed two thousand people. Hey can feel a little grief himself, and she was she was an idiot. So I packed. All right, ok, settle down. But she was, too. In a way. She was done, mike, it ain't never ate a pin. My kid never had a pen. You don't know that I and he's like he's, a mighty enough he's, just half normal, like he's, not he's, not a genius, but he's, not a pin. Ater all right, there's. A good chance. I ate a pin is a boy. So for sure. One of those big ones, too, one of that's like long needles my nan used to use also don't leave pins around. What the fuck is happening in this house? You got a baby crawling around like i'll leave the pin cushion out. She likes to sleep on it. It probably wasn't the only one there, probably forty in there, and just one came out the side. Help us, there are leaking pins. So in eighteen, ninety two, henry frick bought an iron or company, and then railroads a fleet of six steamers. The company now owned its minds, dug its own or loaded it onto its own steamers, landed at its own ports, transported on its own railroads, distributed it's, flashed its blast furnaces and smelted it with coke, brought from its own coal mines and ovens with limestone brought from its own quarries. Sounds like a monopoly. Yeah, they have a pretty good handle on a lot of the process of that kind of locked everything down. Yeah, okay. That's, amazon, right. In the winter of eighteen ninety one, carnegie bought the homestead mill well. Eerie. He appointed henry as his second in command. Knowing henry was intensely anti labor. Okay. The amalgamated association of iron and steel workers, the a, was a union that formed in eighteen, seventy six. Yeah. No, there have been an ugly, violent strike in january eighteen, eighty two. But the union held out and won a complete victory, right? I don't know if you guys you know a lot changes but doesn't end well changes yeah it changes hang out hang in there I don't even know about this story there was another strike in july eighteen eighty nine again the union one the union out appeared to be complete control of the homestead mill membership doubled cash on hand grew to one hundred and forty six thousand dollars okay the fucking killing it yeah the work it was brutal social darwinist herbert spencer said that quote a week in the pittsburgh mills would be enough to make a sane man commit suicide yeah it's the social darwinist yeah that's kind of a lame title by the way that's a hard guy to root for whom social doing assume he didn't make a lot of money that's a hard job yeah it's a lot of it's on spec excuse me do you need his social darwinist absolutely not in this economy no i'm not going to hang out with you and let you know who's the outfit and tell you stuff no darwin who gives a shit works with my kids are leaking pins I don't have time for this that's actually part of I don't care leave it because if you eat a pin if you depend what darwin would say what would he say? That's a fucking idiot yeah get the fuck out of here leave here have you thought about not living pins around for your kids to eat. Yeah, i've thought about it. Okay, yeah. Okay, all right, yeah. Cooler. It sounds like you might need a social darwinist. Yeah, no, I do not. Yeah, wait. Okay. Thean agreement, reached in eighteen, eighty nine was ending on july first, eighteen ninety two. Henry thought those be his chance to deal the union a blow because they kept winning in ninety two. Yes, that contract's up, right, so he's gonna say he's got time, take it to take a democracy. That's, right? Yeah, the steel business was in decline as another capitalist bubble was about to burst. The next year, henry and carnegie saw labor as the place to keep profits coming in. So henry focus on reducing wages of to three hundred and twenty six out of the way. Three thousand eight hundred workers at the company. Okay, the company was making five million dollars a year. He's pretty broke he's fighting over their wages, and what henry's fighting over would save the company. Twenty thousand dollars a year. Yeah, it's, important, it's, important, it's important to do this carnegie, then post a notice to all employees, explained there would be a merger of the three mills, including the homestead mill. The newly created carnegie steel would be non union. The company plans let the current agreement expire than carnegie went to europe. Farewell. Fuck faces wait! U s a. He told henry he could handle the situation in giving it a rest. You\n\nspk_0 : live a\n\nspk_1 : good legal team. Kind of you wanted the ian crushed. He just wasn't going to say it publicly. He believed it got in the way of efficiency. Henry asked the band to take a twenty two percent reduction in wages. Cool, normal request so let's go from there. How'd they take it? They hung him in effigy. Oh, my god, the's negotiations are not going well. Well, they don't seem to know who is that out there? My god, that's me. No, i'm on fire now. Knew they could paper machine so well. But still, the twenty, twenty percent is just for those workers. It's still just twenty thousand dollars, that he's trying to say, which is yeah, cables between henry and carnegie show current carnegie didn't care much about the strike. He was more concerned about henry buying an orchestra, an orchestra on orcas, orchestra, on orchestra, ah, space orchestra, space orchestra. We are our history on. We are space symphony. When we unite in eight pieces in one, we become orchestra, really. That's. Right, that's. What he's bi gonna picture the mighty morphin power rangers, if that's cool with everybody. So anarchist reon was a self playing musical device. It had musical instruments like organ pipes, trumpets, trombones, flutes and piccolo's. What what is happening? It's. Just what is it, it's, just a ball of instruments that rolls around and makes its just like a dick van dyke list. Music making machine, it's, just a bunch of instruments, a bunch of instruments that look later, the cartoon band fight. Yes, on they play themselves it's. How the fuck do they play themselves? They're just sitting there, the guitars trumpeting the trumpets, harping, yeah, I mean, it's, just a brass than string instrument orgy, not just brass and string. I mean, what is it? How does it work? I don't know. What is it, it's, do you have a picture of one? Bring it up, it's. Big. It better be. Oh, look, your tattoos! Yeah. Oh, shit, it is really big. It is really fucking it looks like a dumb ass oregon that's. What i'll say, like a look at all that shit that's, a lot of there's, a lot going on there. Oh, my god, you're killing it, someone's got a, nobody plays it, it doesn't own. Thank you, thank you. Okay, so it's somehow is just ah, haunted music. Teacher's office. It would cost henry. We'll see six thousand one hundred dollars why's. He getting it again, i'm so deep, no one just for shits and gigs. Yeah, okay, remember he's fighting over twenty thousand dollars. He wants the six thousand dollars music machine for his house, so I put the need, eh? I wish noah want it's indeed. Now carnegie who everyone thinks is pro laborer never talked about the strike carnegie wrote that it would quote the r o he's got high hopes for he wrote that it would give great pleasure and be a marvel in pittsburgh so he's just excited that henry's gonna buy this new thing right okay they were they were this is what they were discussing while they fought the labors over twenty thousand dollars huh yeah no that's fine that's regular ivory tower chit chat you in may henry made it very clear he was preparing for a strike because he had a twelve foot tall fence topped with barbed wire built around the perimeter of the mill and the second offense with barbwire like starts getting built that's when you like we gotta move some things up make a move now it was a six hundred acre perimeter that he built it around they're also peepholes built in the fence so rifles could be put through I thought that I thought so that the peasants could sort of be like orphans at a fogged up window at a christmas dinner is that him who wouldn't give rhys lies but instead it's to kill them yeah it's to kill that was maybe a way for them to just watch the music man roll around in his musical more g time machine that that sounds great but these holes over killing humans right better humans who want money when they were twenty thousand dollars. My i'll fuck off. Why can't we have slave? I said, yeah, a little early on that one, I guess sometimes you string me along. I'm holding your hand, like, yeah, he said, slavery so by june, he had built observation towers, this's building a jail, right building in jail. Yeah, he's building a musical jail. Is just filled. Yeah, he's built jail. The musical. The workers started calling homestead fort fricks frank for brick. Okay, right, henry told workers that he would not negotiate, and they should not expect conditions to improve. Go home. So ok, yeah, so that's, what i'm doing, I built the fort, and you get nothing. Yeah, but have you ever heard a ukulele drum? Be honest, yes, sir, give me one. Yes, frank, he wrote to robert pinkerton of the pinkerton agency. You guys are good guys, you got to reach out, okay, we're looking from some tactical shifts. You came to the right place. Have you bought a drum yano? You know, in the red track, if you have quote, we will want three hundred guards for service at our home still, mills as a measure prevention against interference with our plan to start the operations of the works on july six, eighteen, ninety two, these guards should be assembled not later than the morning of july fifth, but surely fencing materials, people's guard towers, pinkerton security guards has to cost more than what you're pitching on for your seven twenty grand. No, but it's it could not be more pennywise dollar foolish you're like, careful, they're trying to get twenty grand let's spend a million to stop them, but there's also something joyous about seeing the life go out of the laborers eyes, you know? I mean, like, if you've ever if you've ever seen, like sometimes i'll get onto an amazon factory and you've got to go to the people and i'll take, i'll take a stack of money and i'll light it on fire in front of them, and I watch I watch them slowly die, and I think this this is what this is, what it's all about. This is what america is, so if you've never seen like, ah, human, give up hope, I don't think I understand what he's doing right, cue the g accordion so the union called for a strike on june twenty ninth, eighteen, ninety two. On what grounds. Again, they don't. They want to be on a lot of the bullshit, right? Yes, right. Two thousand steelworkers barricaded the front to stop non union members, some entering so there's, there's, union and nonunion guys at the factory. There's. Actually, more non une guys that work in the factory than you guys, okay, the plant was on the monaf moment river. We did this earlier, mono ga nala. No, I did it. Mo so monogram the men started patrolling the river right the union guys okay trolling the river that night being guys try to talk the non union guys into honoring the strike not a nonunion guy asked what would happen if they didn't want to leave in a union man yelled back come out anyway or if you don't you have to be a rapid runner so that insinuates probably not life or property yep yeah at nine p m the non union workers left the mill and work stopped okay so they're on board there are right okay even the mayor eyes a union mill worker and he and he's on strike the mayor's working in the mill yeah okay nice second in town sure strikers were posted all over to sound an alarm if scabs were seen heading towards the milk okay henry asked a company to retrofit to barges with a floating dormitory a mess hall and a food preparation area weight on his little his little bunkers they'll barge it's on he's he's gotten taller he's about to barge is ok she's having the me putting dorms on them okay okay so is right opening a high school well college boat you this strikers assumed the barges would be used to house scabs the strikers start to organize in a military manner for thousand downward divide into three groups or divisions headed by commanders and below the commanders were eight captains okay the u s navy officials were concerned about delays and steel deliveries, which would cause delays on ships being built right. Can't have that. No being believed that the navy contracts would make the company cave in, okay, and benjamin harrison. President benjamin harrison sent a message to carney, carnegie and henry, and tell him to fix the mass. On july fourth, henry sent a coded cable to carnegie in london. Quote. Carnegie morgan, london small pond, pony plunge, repairing pond, pony, choke watchman arrived, plunge, morning board early. Yeah, so was he just sitting on the cable? I assume that's about the pod pond purge? I assume it's about the big musical device. Yeah, okay, yeah. You call the guy over to fix that he's like oh, shit! I gotta call some friends. I don't know, henry and asked the sheriff of the county the county to protect the company's property on july fifth, sheriff mcleary arrived at union headquarters with two deputies. He surprised the union was super grable even even offered to assist keeping the peace, saying he could deputize five hundred union man it's I had a lot of guys who could be sheriffs here that's way all be shared. All right, well, we're pretty good. I wouldn't talk to him outside. They're pretty cool. Guys all show five hundred of them are sheriffs? Yeah, turn them all into shape like a wizard. Guys, i'm trying to keep their all sheriffs one of them's above me and this guy really good, really good. He's great. You're not good at this. I know. Which is why this guy's going to actually probably take the reins of a great direction. You gotta hear this guy talk. He is a charmer onboard family whose will be I should turn around and get the hell out of dodge. Good to catch up. The hell is that that pin come out of your daughter yet? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a tense moment you could hear a tries to get out of here. Too soon. So the sheriff said, he didn't see any any problems, but he would still need to send men. He went back to pittsburgh to get more men. Six p, m came word that deputies were coming on a train teo set up at fort frick, two thousand men gathered at the rail station off the train step, the sheriff's deputy and six other officers ships the two thousand who are there, like the union. Yeah, okay, right, um, off the train, right, the chief deputy said. He was going he's going to the steelworks, and the union men were very riled up. A man raised his hand to quiet them and told the chief deputy to follow him to union headquarters. They're the union committee members explain to the deputies the data choice that they could leave safely or not safely. And the deputies were like, we'll do this safely thing. And they left right. Same seats. So now henry believed he tried the legal channels and that way hasn't though now well he brought he tried to send the sheriff's shares were sent away huh so now he thinks he has the right to bring in the pinkertons it seems ok which is weird because he had already messaged the pinkerton yeah so it's almost like he had set it up because they were already boarding the retrofitted barge is ten miles downstream it's just ink okay the sheriff deputized the pinkertons they were armed of three hundred pistols two hundred winchester's what the fuck's a winchester writes a windbreaker oh no sorry windbreaker they've got windbreakers and gun all right you get to choose one i'm not an idiot windbreaker how's the winds pretty bad so bad you're gonna need it to brain this will break it because it's got holes here and in the back that's a windbreaker exactly what it is thank you it's like a parachute shirt it's a parachute anyway i'm taking two I don't know I love the things okay just the one already no fun a spotter saw the barges and whistled at the union and a whistle the union was blown warning everyone there was an invasion happening before I am the river banks were packed with thousands of workers and citizens of the town the crowd consisted not only of men but of women who are armed with clubs. Nice nice ladies ladies what's up it's, just that your loving their husbands know jesus. Hey, after you're done using that pinkerton, you want, peg me? As the barges made their way to shore, shots were fired. Union leader o'donnell called for calm, but it was pointless when the barges arrived. The strict strikers were the pinkertons not to get off okay and donald hush the crowd and yelled, quote, in the name of god and humanity, don't attempt to land don't attend to enter these works by force. The pinkerton captain responded, quote, we were sent here to take possession of this property and to guard it for the his company. We don't wish to shed blood. If you men don't withdraw, we will mow every one of you down and enter in spite of you. How do you say you don't want to draw blood right before that? Yeah, that's actually not true, we don't draw blood, but we're willing to kill all of you immediately. We'll move down like it's, like we don't want to draw blood well if we have tio mowed down is a whole different sort of that's, the most blood, all that, all the blood, all of the blood, we don't want to draw blood, we want all of your blood. So the pictures put down a gang plague okay and then a striker laid down on it interesting then pinker pinker demand tried to shove him aside and the guy who was laying down shot him hey guy hitting the pinkerton and thigh so the striker had a gun on him and when the pinkerton went to push him he was like bang even bolder yeah okay I just wait this way I wish this has been like and then he shot him in the dick but insurance so close stuff we shot him in the thigh so much better and then the shooting started well that started william foia striker was voted the strikers shot and hit the commander of the pinkertons captain hind the pink cannons open fire to the crowd killing two and injuring eleven the crowd shot back killing two and wounding twelve pinkertons the shooting continued for ten minutes the tug boats that were the tugboat that was towing the barges had wounded agents onboard and pulled away leaving the barges okay awesome way hey bye bye way got a gun here it's gonna learn a lot of trumpets like a flesh wound he's got a little tic you got there you didn't realize I know but larry got hit right here on the arm it's true look look right there. Yeah it's like a scratch my god see later pinkerton's of a good luck on your dorm boat. I'm gonna kill you if I find your tug boy. Okay, if you find me, I have to come back and get you to pull you out. Why you can't leave without may. I see what you did there. Bye. Yeah, so awkward tohave an argument on a boat. You never asked how larry wass. I don't care about larry, I could see his elbow. Oh, yeah. It's, larry it's, all closing in. I see my grand parents, it's a scratch. I want to act. I want to dance. Yeah, there was an instrument. So the strikers took cover by and scrap iron. The pinkertons went below deck and cut holes in the size of the barges so they could shoot from almost total safety. Okay, hundreds of women stood on the banks of the river and chanted, killed the pinkerton! I mean, let's. Just make the movie. Just cause of that. Yes, that's, that's the fuckin scene a lot. S so great, the mayor asked the townspeople to help defend the peace. This brought five thousand more people to the hills above the mill. A twenty, pound brass cannon across the river started being fired at the barges with bar just really got less. They really got screwed. Yeah, the tugboat shooting at him. Hey, larry, motherfucker. I almost died. Tug boats circling back again in pittsburgh, thousands of steelworkers prepared to head to homestead to help at eight a m the pinkertons tried to get off the barges, which just led to more shooting at the pinger to sure, yeah, you can't leave. They also tried to shoot their way out and they killed four strikers. But now the pinkard fingered and started jumping off the barge and trying to swim away. Oh, my god, not good. I mean, this really screwed him it is, but I love the pinkertons getting shot at jumping in the room. It is good, but I think you're pinkerton yeah, yeah, no it's, a pinkerton, but who gives a fuck of your pinkerton? Did they wear pink? Yeah, they had pink shirts, they did have pink shirts, you lying to me? You're lying to me because I picture now, like kind of pink security guards like, yep, candy cane security go there dressed all in pink. They were naked, yeah. As the battle raged on the a union, I was trying to end it and asked the sheriff to request a meeting with henry frick. So in the middle of all the shooting and the killing, they're like, can we get a fucking meeting to end this? And and henry frick was like, no cool guy, this is a good guy. He knew things got worse. The governor would send in the militia and if the militia came, the strike would be done. Wow, this dude it's good. Yeah. No. Yeah. At ten. Fifty am the tug return to get the barges. Who? Good news? Bad news, how've. You guys been? What are you talking about? How we've been? We've been getting shot out here like frogs since you didn't ask. Larry is fine. I don't care. He looked fine when you ditched us. He went to the doctor and got a bandage and I don't care. This is why we left this's. Exactly. It's this attitude that's not great. Tie yourself to us now, tugboat. No. Why did you come back to gloat? You little asshole? Say hi. See if your attitude change. You saw avery bad attitude. Okay, you remind me of a girl who ate a pin. That's. What you're like, pin girl. I'm going to kill you, tugboat captain, you have to get you have to get off the march. So you are such a sassy little captain. I am going to strangle you when I get off here. Do you understand me? Sure. Okay. See you later. Oh, my god, if you fucking come back here! Bye! Just the cut comes back, everyone shoots back at the tug in the time and the tugboats, like okay, that i'm no, we're leaving again. He just took off now, that's not worth it, you know, we can say we tried, we can say we tried and it didn't happen. It's, like the idea of like, smokey, you turns on the water out god, he is unbelievable! Later, where's he going just away, it's, I love to get an update, so now the strikers were up on high ground, they had three hundred rifles and they were just shooting at. The barge is okay. They killed a pinkerton around noon, then the strikers decided to light. The barge is on fire. Yeah, yeah, okay, clearly, thiss audience is roping this side of the strikers. I mean the side of the tug boat, which is a small sect. But I found a little niche for myself. I'm pro tugboat. So the strikers sends a raft covered in oil soaked timber. Oh, my god, help's! On the way. But they're on fire. There's! No help! That's. What? They set it on fire and push it toward the barges, the fingertips. Shit. Don't you want some water? All the pinkertons start freaking out, and the captain threatened to shoot any agent that ran off, but the raft ended up burning itself out before it got to the bar. Okay, it's, a fun, sort of like. Sorry I yelled at you all back. There didn't mean a word of it. So then they ordered ah, they loaded a flat car, right? So ah, not not a river thing thing for land, right? A black car, a flat car like a train car. Okay, we invented the car and in more interesting news, it shall be your demise. And they loaded it up with oil drums. Now, is that flammable back then? Yep. Okay. They set them on fire. Okay? And then they push the car says, flying down the rail towards the warf and the barges. So they've essentially set up like a real life, fiery mouse trap or the barges where you just slowly get to be like, well, now that and now it's like, don't hit the marble now, it's like mad max. Yeah, that's what we have and it always has been. But the car, the flat car stopped at the edge of the river and just burnt out. Man, if you're on the barge, you're like another nail biter. Okay, we need a plan. So they got dynamite. Oh, no! Okay. And now what? And they started lighting the dynamite and throwing it at the barge in and just think, you gotta love it. One like plants. See always seems to be the one where it's like throw. But they only hit the barge once, and it did almost no damage whatsoever. No, okay, so next they poured oil into the river hopinto, light it on fire. They are trying to create, like a trail towards it with oil. Yeah, but they can. This is before under siege, came out of my wrong. Yeah, okay, but they couldn't like oil on fire. They couldn't like this. Look on fire. Okay, and now, what's. Next, they put dynamite in a duck and taught it to swim. And four pm five thousand men from shaolin, iwerks, pittsburgh and elsewhere arrived at homesteads. Now, more dudes, so good, more more dynamite arms. The president of the union was pleading with henry to talk to union reps, but he wouldn't. He was also trying to get the crowds to calm down, but they started blasting fourth of july fireworks toward the barges. Now, do you mean they were dipping into their fourth of july supply of fire? We're after it's, right after for the july, when they got back to the ship tonight, leftovers on the fourth of july, that's just like sparklers and snaps, not that's, just like it's, not the good stuff. We're going to fire a roman candle. If the's best it's show much, then adam with some black cats. Yeah, the picture is like, this is beautiful there, enjoying the shit, god damn it! At five pen, the pinkertons raised a white flag. Okay, it was over after thirteen hours, and as the pinkertons came off the barge, their guns were taken away as well as their hats. Dave, you can disarm a man. But you shouldn't dishonor a man. Let a man have some pride and keep his goddamn hat on. Can't I have any dignity? Yeah, yeah, ah! He's dead. Nice try, asshole! The pigments were walked between two rows of strikers. People threw stones, spit at them on dh, severely beat them. Well, you know, a hat could stop two out of three of those, yep. Celtic the strikers boarded the barges, looted them and then set them on fire. That's the right order, though. Yeah, you know what, a fire that loot. The pinkertons were handed over to the sheriff, who put them on a train back to pittsburgh, all for twenty grand, twenty grand, all for twenty years. We got a bunch of dead people, burn barges. Twenty twenty, twenty grand. The next day, at ten am, sheriff mcleary sent a telegram to the governor begging for state intervention. The governor responded by demanding that the sheriff first do everything that he could to restore the peace. Two hours later, the sheriff telegram again asking for assistance. And at three pm, the governor told the sheriff to recruit his own troops. So the governors helpful he's, not he's, just a marlak that they want. I'm not. I don't know what the governor was, but it sounds like he does, asshole. Well, no, but he doesn't want to send his own troops because he knows once his troops were sent, he knows what it means. Like you doesn't mean he's gonna fuck up the strikers. I don't think it sounds like he doesn't want to. This is all that. Just break up the striker situation that has form now that the pinkertons are gone. Yeah. Okay. The governor had a several troops on july sixth when the fighting started, but he had not yet chosen to use them. He was worried the townspeople were involved in setting. The militia will lead to a massacre. Okay, which happens? Sure. Yeah. No. Yeah. They say never. I mean, never, obviously, not now. These are great, but no. But on july twelfth, the pennsylvania state militia arrived. They were now they were now six thousand troops surrounding the mill. Company officials were backto work by ten a m the next day, scabs were brought in and how's on mill grounds. The furnaces were lit two days later. Okay, homestead. Homestead was placed under martial law. The company press charges against sixteen of the strike leaders for conspiracy, right and murder, thie union charges. Executives with murder eventually come from a compromise was reached where all parties drop, charges that everybody was going to be accused of murder to compromise. But we're all murderers. How about a compromise where we're all murderers? Let me talk first tank way. Hey, we'll go through a plan. We actually, she oh, we'll do a whole sex with other men, okay, i'm gonna actually, i'm gonna stop you right there. I shake a guard for looking at me. Weird. Did you say, you shag one tank, go. We all go to jail for murder were actually none of us were going to get charges the way that we're going to go with it. So next time i'll talk first, we're going to need your hat and badge. I says, not what I was picturing. I write sex stories, okay, let's, stop you right there again. I'm stopping you and your son have in mind, i'm stopping you a lot and you're still talking through my stop and that's how I outrank you want mei mei stop a bunch of stories about murder. Jackson, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, no more words out of that mouth, some way. Hey, you just said one more word, none has a whipped cream camp. Shut your mouth! Shut up! Shut up, hank! Hank, no shirts, hanky panky, stop no more. I'm negotiating. You're not now. Now we've already come up with a solution. Your murder, no, okay, all right. Men. A lot of the non union. The new non union workers were black, which led to a race war in the mill between nonunion black and white workers on july twenty second. So let's, just throw in a race war and with a side of a race war. The next day, henry frick was meeting with carnegie steel vice president, the carnegie steel vice president, in his pittsburgh office, when a russian anarchist, alexander berkman, barged in. Yes, have a hero and he's russian. He was holding a revolver and a sharp into steel file. You pick. With me as curious, right or left. Hey, little berkman shot at nearly point blank range, a bullet went through henry's ear lobe. We'll hit him in the neck at the base of the school skull on the bullet lodged in his back, and he went down on the ground and burt brickman fighter, second time hitting henry and the neck again. This wound started bleeding profusely. Ah, the carnegie steel vice president, grad, berkman by the arm. Stopping in from firing again, henry somehow managed to help the vp tackle berkman to the ground. Jesus as the three men struggled on the don't fucking invite an anarchist in your office. No, i'm talking about his job. Yeah, I mean, but okay, anarchist got shit done yet. So i'm talking about having a hole in your neck of being, like stopped us around. Yeah. I mean, I have a lead on him. You tackle him. He survived typhoid and scarlet fever, and as, yeah, growing pain. What if a bunch of pins just shot out when he got shot? So much better. I'm a doctor. So, as the three men struggled on the floor, berkman stabbed henry four times in the leg with a sharpened steel file. And then other employees finally rushed in and stop berkman. Henry was in critical condition, and doctors at the hospital gave him little chance of survival. Okay, while the doctors operated on him, he dealt with business matters. What business? What? I mean, he was just like, don't cave. What about fucking enjoying life for a second, I was like, what about taking a break? What about when you're dying? You're not like I got to get some paperwork done, save this receipt. I got to write some checks. That's, my daughter, yeah. I'm getting some blood on these cheques, but there is still good, right? Yes. Oh, no, your nurse, aziz being operated on, he cabled carnegie to assure him he was not morning ally, old john, my good buddy, what is what's new with you? I've got a story, you're not going to believe. On hearing the news that henry had been shot, one of the soldiers guarding the homestead mills shouted, quote, hurrah! For the man who shot him! Can we just bring bring back her wrong? Three cheers and three cheers. Three, three, three cheers, unquestionably like probably in the eighteen hundreds. If someone said three cheers for anyone, your age is like, I give a shit. No, don't do it! No! So after the the soldier did that, he was a private okay on offer. Officer had him hung whoa, from a tent pole by his thumb. What? I won't die until his heartbeat grew so faint, a surgeon ordered that he be taken down. What the what just happened? Some dude got some news until a surgeon. It was like hell die, his heart, everyone's like what's happening right now. But even when he was taken down, the soldier refused to apologize and was given a dishonorable discharge over the thumb game. His head was half shaved. No it's, either, and he was kicked out of the camp wearing rags. What just happened to everything or an upside down's ville? He dida, harada that he shouldn't have done, and he got hung by his thumbs. Hurrah the wrong way. So henry turned out to be okay. He went back to work within a week. What I know, right? Every time he was near you is just like sorry, there. That's. Better focus shot in the neck, twice, shot the neck twice. And then a week later, like that was everybody. So he never really stopped working as he dealt with the strike from his hospital bed. He also attended the funeral of his son, henry clay frick jr, who passed away on august third. Okay, so cools kids are dead. I mean, that's bad, but at least he's suffering. I don't know if you know what butts used for. Besides pegging berkman was charged and found guilty of the attempted murder he was sentenced to twenty two years in prison. Support for the strikers start to fade the press coverage on their attack on the pinkertons did not help and now the assassination attempt made it worse after months the picket line began to be crossed regularly the militia was pulled out october thirteenth after eight ninety five day occupation the strike left the union broke it cost ten thousand a week for sixteen hundred strikers on august twentieth eighteen ninety two with a vote of one hundred one to ninety one thean voted to return to work ending the homestead strike and it cost ten thousand they had two hundred forty six thousand dollars and they started now they have nothing and it's all over twenty thousand yeah smart smart stuff it was believed carnegie was pro union he was famous for saying quote, thou shalt not take my neighbor's job all the workers thought henry frick was standing in carnegie's way but andrew carnegie put henry frick incharge knowing exactly what he would do the strike resulted in the a losing their powerful position within the american labor movement employers refused to sign with the union by nineteen hundred not a single steel work in pennsylvania was unionized the union remained active in ohio and illinois for awhile but slowly faded. But nineteen o nine membership was only sixty, three hundred hey was taken over by the steel workers organizing committee in nineteen thirty six, henry and carnegie started falling out. They had many differences and fights over business. Han we had offered to sell land to the company at five hundred dollars an acre less than the appraised value. But carnegie made insinuations about the prophet henry make from the sale, so henry withdrew his offer to carnegie and sold the land to someone else for a half a million dollars more. Okay, henry then responded to carnet carnegie's insinuations in a meeting in which the minutes were distributed throughout the company carnegie, calling the board to request the resignation of henry since andrew carnegie was the majority shareholder no one can oppose, so why even call the meeting? I mean, you're just just wanted to see everybody in person again. I call emotion to get rid of that guy motion approved by move on howto votes work that's it. I'm the guy, i'm like all the business people in one like piano. Ah. So henry just put in his vaccinate resignation, but card you wanted him out of the company completely. He pushed out henry's interest in the company seized that would force henry to sell eleven million less than at the market value. To do this, he altered a thirteen year old document carnegie did okay, and had it signed by principal owners who were not present at the original signing by henry. Okay, this is just sort of a little rip in the fabric of time. Carnegie than paid one point million one point five million for stock that was worth ten times as much. Henry then bought one of the greatest, greatest lawsuits in pennsylvania history against carnegie. The result was that hannah received thirty one million in securities, which would later bring him twenty three million more than carnegie tried to force him to sell for it's. Henry. Wow. Okay, henry fix it. Became the largest real estate owner in pittsburgh in august nineteen. Nineteen. Henry carnegie died from pneumonia right before he died. Wait. He died from the carnegie, okay? Before he died, he sent a message to his old friend henry requesting a meeting. Ah, handy responded, you can tell carnegie all meet him, tell him i'll see him in hell, where we're both going huh? That's that is tough for a secretary back then, though. She's like and should I go ahead? Go on, read it all. Ok, so just let him know that, huh? Is he coming? Well, what date did you want to meet him in hell and I i'm what i'm sorry about the whole thing. Okay? Yeah. My own friend henry coming. I'm about to die. Well, unfortunately, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hey. Sorry. That's not there. I cannot meet that. I'm sorry. I will meet you. I'll meet you in the place where we're both going. Oh, hell. What? Yeah. No. Eso what date works, I guess, is what i'm trying to figure out. Because the next week and a half, you're jammed with funerals. Time dying. Yeah, yeah, no. So that's, why? I'm saying we should do this before you die, you know? And where does he want to do it? Is that what I should send back or how do you maybe what will do? Oh, gosh. I'm just if I can't pull the trigger. A little whips. Okay, you're dying right now, okay? Okay. Okay, here's, what i'm gonna do, i'm gonna make you a bunch of sandwiches to take to hell, and i'll put him under your tongue like a piece of gold when you're going over the river sticks and then and no andrews, mr kudo, mr could talk to mr carnegie. I don't think you know death, I know, but i'm just going to schedule that, oh, boy, let's, do egg salad with dill. I'll slap him. I'll cut him into fourths and put him under your tongue. Did I do good and you just before he died? Carnegie wrote that he felt guilty about homestead and said, not one drop of blood was worth it. You know, maybe now this is just me, but maybe he should have thought of that it's bill when he was doing it or its support so much bullshit. Deathbed confession. Go fuck yourself, you fucking yeah, it means fuck off! You don't get to sit on your death bed. Go. I'm sorry about everybody. I kill no more that is, that is one of the major problems with organized religion. Probably. Is that the belief that, like at the very angelique oops and like that's it oh, good, welcome to heaven. Ah, let's, play volleyball on cloud he's. Fine, he said, oops, I hope stitt. But then, if you're on your deathbed and you don't get it out, though, before I go, I want teo eyes right now, he's going to get teo got I gave him sandwiches. Less than four months understand you've packed sandwiches under my tongue well the dark lord loves eggs thank you dark lord so close less than four months later in december second nineteen nineteen henry clay frick died of a heart attack after his death the new york tribune wrote quote the name of frick was abhorrent to a great number of his fellow citizens as the largest real estate owner in pittsburgh henry left one hundred fifty acres of undeveloped land to the city for use as a public park. He also left substantial funds for the maintenance of the park two million dollars henry clay frick park opened in nineteen twenty seven eight years after his death it is now the largest minute largest municipal park in Cleveland in two thousand sorry in pittsburgh pittsburgh now now pittsburgh they opened it in Cleveland cause you guys hated him so much I got to pick bullet here stick with gary I might I might have been right in that at the end and got tired uh in two thousand thirteen researchers at the university of pittsburgh determined that contrary to the south fork fishing and hunting clubs claims the dam had been lowered by three feet not just got what well we did it thanks for the grant who is going to research back then well nobody but I mean at this point you'd think we'd be like why don't we blame rich people whenever we can ok, sir they're just there might be some other things we could do with that. I'm fine with this kind of shit. No, i'm time traveling. Damn solutions are high on my priority list. Okay, so they determined it had been lowered by three feet, not one, and that the changes reduce the dam's ability to discharge stormwater by half. Henry, clay frick, andrew carnegie and others were only responsible for the deaths of thousands. Today you can see henry's amazing art collection at the henry clay frick house on the upper east side in manhattan. Henry clay frick became a hero to the upper classes forever. After crushing the unions, one can still google his name and see articles that fawn over his business smarts. They neglect to include that he was responsible for the death of thousands. So that's why the study matters, because if you go online and you google his name, you'll see a bunch of fucking dickheads from forbes in the wall street journal and shit time out of great of a businessman. He is, but they missed the mass murder part disassociated with them so that e I agree. I don't disgrace, but don't they always miss the mass murder part? Yeah, but that's what i'm here for, yeah, I agree. But, yeah. It just is so terrible when the like, like the icons, are pieces of shit. So it's, not even like there was like a system they're following that, like started rooted in goodness, it's, all just bile. So ella has a park named every guy who shot his wife in the eye of god. Pittsburgh has a guy, a park named after guy, murdered a bunch of union workers and and help killed thousands of people in a town. I guess we're lucky. Finally, someone who makes griffith seemed grounded. But you know, his his relatives get to live on with tons of wealth. His name is a museum. He's got let's fucking art manet's and all this shit. He he should be considered a monster by our society. He should be. We should be no different than charles manson. He is a fucking monster. Wouldn't that be a good thing to do for us to just get a god damn list of shit heads that we honor still were no reason and just start taking some boxes and just removing some bullshit so that people at least, like, eat because but, I mean, if you see a statue of someone like if you don't know shit and I don't speak from experience but if you see a statue of someone you like a good guy, a good person, a great human, right? You're like there's a statue. But in reality, all the statues are just built on bullshit and there's. Just for some reason. We act like getting statues out are like removing pins from torsos for some reason. And all you need is a god damn bulldozer and a petition. At some point, i'm going to go to the fucking city council and see what happens, but be like, hey, can we name griffith park after his wife and said to him, but you guys should do the same thing here. That part should be named after martha. Yeah, because he's, a fucking murder is a mass murder. Martha frick. Yeah, yeah, the little girl at a pin come outside and put a statue of her with a little pain coming out. Pin park and it can. It can have eternal puss coming down the side. No it's like a fountain. Where it's, just like. Just shooting out of her side, guys, thank you so much for coming out. We really appreciate it. I can't thank you enough. Uh, yeah, appreciate it, thank you.","speakerNames":["Dave Anthony","Gareth Reynolds","Henry Clay Frick"],"summary":"<p>Comedians Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds examine Henry Clay Frick and his love of steel and money.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.redbubble.com/people/mrfoz/collections/439251-the-dollop\"> OFFICIAL MERCH</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dolloppodcast.com/tour-schedule.html\">TOUR DATES</a></p> <p>SOURCES</p>"}}

No it's, not good. It's. That was the whole thing was a bad, short story. His father died when he was eight, because that because someone has to fucking die in the first two cents.\n\nspk_0 : It is a tradition\n\nspk_2 : in his.

So people he's just getting on that fucking wagon share quote. Sometimes i'm led to believe that our workmanship surpasses that of the indians themselves. What what he's saying he makes a better bonnet than then war cloud made for himself\n\nspk_0 : a sure sister. Did war cloud ever catch winterfest thing you're like, what is he doing? Your bonnet on it?\n\nspk_2 : Sitting bull's course it. No, no! This is\n\nspk_0 : geronimo's broach collection. He loved flair.

Then he got his hands on an embalmed, native american woman from a bankrupt undertaker. From what fuck who? I mean, he was like storage wars. The other taker. Right.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, man, I hit hard times. I mean, the only possession I really have left is this a bald lady. I'm selling her, but why undervalue cbs or too easy payments? So he put up a sign.

Yeah.\n\nspk_2 : So here is killing it. He was now worth over one hundred fifty thousand dollars and had two homes, and then the panic of eighteen, ninety three came and harry was broke, and he was determined to make it all back. The evening post in Denver went up for sale, and harry want to buy it. He believed someone could position himself as the people's champion and make quite a bit of money. Uh huh. What\n\nspk_0 : was the panic of eighteen, ninety three? I mean, I know, I know, but I don't. Yeah, obviously, I know so capitalism,\n\nspk_2 : capitalism.

Khun pick letters and abstract numbers, anant animals and also\n\nspk_2 : animals. Yeah, we're we've got one of the most divers lottery's out there. That's. Awesome. If you ever win you and big, because it's animals, roman numerals, letters. Oh, vegetables. Oh, that's, huh? Carrot was on the one last week.\n\nspk_0 : Well, I certainly didn't pick any of those,\n\nspk_2 : so if you want in it's one hundred dollars, and I want your daughter. Just gimme a second here. Just just she's. Fantastic.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, yeah. I mean, now that I know you could pick vegetables, i'll do broccoli, kau di and\n\nspk_2 : question mark that's pretty good. So the numbers this week were twelve, fourteen, seven, nine and eight\n\nspk_0 : this week was all numbers. Was that next week's? No, but just so you just get another lot of in your head. Yeah. Whoa, you gotta gotta re brain.\n\nspk_2 : I gotta spend anything in my head.\n\nspk_0 : All right, then i'm gonna pick numbers now fifteen to eight. Five.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, you're so close.\n\nspk_0 : What is it, donkey wang? Bo, how come every time I pick numbers that goes two characters and shit it's\n\nspk_2 : just how the numbers come out and the objects in the other stuff and you're\n\nspk_0 : good at your job. Yeah, lotteries are tough. Yeah, yeah, right. You try running it with all this stuff. I couldn't.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah. Okay. Well, some just going. Take your daughter.\n\nspk_0 : Hey, I know you earned them. You're in the money and the daughter. So bye, grace. Go with this man now. Hey was arrested twice for what? Once for loitering around a lottery, loitering around honoring what is that? A fine buddy. You hang around a lottery. I love that he's running an\n\nspk_2 : organized gambling syndicate where nobody has a chance of winning. But it's, the loitering charge, they fucking got him. I'm\n\nspk_0 : standing around.\n\nspk_2 : Once he was arrested for conducting a lottery, whichever times and that was illegal, he just paid small fines, and that would leave the town and go on and on how it was working in chicago, and he'd heard all about friend. He thought friend might be the guy to partner up with\n\nspk_0 : cher. He's got a good track record,\n\nspk_2 : and and buy that newspaper. So one day, he learned that fred was in the lobby of a chicago hotel on harry, walked in and looked it. Fred fred looked back and said, quote, who are you and what do you want, pairing, kid? I hear you've got a million dollars in safety deposit boxes on. I'm going to shake you down for half of it fred was impressed.\n\nspk_0 : What every moment of that was unpredictable. Horrible intro, terrible pitch. I like what I see.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, that much lower standards for the original vision of shock tank. Yeah. S o, they sat down and they talked, and harry said he wanted to buy the Denver Post but needed capital, so fred agreed to put up twelve thousand five hundred by it.\n\nspk_0 : This is right after they met,\n\nspk_2 : I think they talked for a while about it, but, yeah, they want that. They went to lunch there at lunch, and\n\nspk_0 : they had lunch. Okay, I don't know\n\nspk_2 : there's, a meal that makes sense. Harry would be the, quote, publishing brains. So the two men bought the post on october twenty eight, eighteen, ninety five. Fred was thirty four, harry was thirty nine. They were now newspaper men. Yeah. Is this rupert murdoch in some way it goes, they were very different. Fred was private, with few close friends and very tightfisted. He once told harry not to tip big quote. It only spoils a man toe over, pay him to give him something he doesn't deserve\n\nspk_0 : from fucking karaoke ce you spoil it, you'll get a taste of it. Harry\n\nspk_2 : was short, roli poli, fun loving in his shop.\n\nspk_0 : Well, now i'm having fun, a showman. I know that's, what a showman. Look at mei. I'm mary that's, just a weirdo standing, eh? I want to say we tumbled down on him, that's, not a show, it's gonna be fun. All we need are curtains\n\nspk_2 : you haven't hit on the show yet\n\nspk_0 : now, not that, but I buy. Yeah, wow, i'm going to spin around! Look, who's got a cane now. Yeah.\n\nspk_2 : Their plan was to attack everyone who wasn't a working man with their paper fred's advice to harry was, quote, write the news for all the people, not just the rich and important, or those who think they are. Harry said, quote, half the town is good, and half the town is bad. The good ones will read the post to congratulate themselves on being so holy and the bad ones to see what we've found out about them, okay, so they immediately began sensational attacks against anyone in authority, saying they were, quote, unsuited to the people. All the governors were, quote, bad for the state and unfit for office. How many governors were there? Well, each one that came through,\n\nspk_0 : okay, I thought that was like no one ever hello where the governor's unit they\n\nspk_2 : hammered senator tom patterson, owner of the rocky mountain news. Patterson tried to ignore them, but he finally fought back in his pages. This led fred to write the first of his editorial columns titled so the people may know. I don't know. This calm will become a regular fixture, and fred will use it as a blunt instrument against his and s eyes. That's like sinclair. Yeah, but but but can't kill us. Uh, andheri dove into the label yellow journalism quote were yellow, but we're red. Ari. Ari, wait, are you know they really should just have the fucking burn the whole place down by sun that yeah, well, yeah, but we're ready. Yeah, do a second drop come back to me with something else. We're one of the first newspapers ever. Although good slogans are\n\nspk_0 : taking fucking go back is the wild west slogan wise attack wear blue oh, my god! Get in office goto work yellow, red, catchier get a showman to sing\n\nspk_2 : it they came up with slogans for the pope post calling it your big brother and the paper with the heart and soul\n\nspk_0 : what is it like a smooth jazz station that's, right?\n\nspk_2 : Meanwhile, rumors immediately began swirling that the post was blackmailing and strong arming advertisers. That doesn't sound like it. It didn't help that harry on fred for harry said he and fred were, quote, dangerous babies,\n\nspk_0 : dangerous babies, it's fucking great movie. By the way, you never say that mel gibson and danny glover dangerous babies came out after\n\nspk_2 : the later weapon movies. That was kind of like a look who's talking mates late the weapon thing,\n\nspk_0 : i'm getting a little too young for this. I'm a racist. Let's, go find sweet tits, jos from the media.\n\nspk_2 : Harry also said that they had had ways of knowing things, and it would be good for businesses and others to buy ads in the post. What so that sort of sounds like strong arming. Yeah, you're saying that making money they moved into a new building. The walls of their office were painted flaming red, sure,\n\nspk_0 : nice that's, a nice vibe. Welcome to hell. Yeah,\n\nspk_2 : they called it the red room. Everyone else in town quickly start to call it the bucket of blood. Jesus. What? They actually got there's. Other people in to do the slogan. Better it's wisdom of the crowd right\n\nspk_0 : there, that's a rod, his room, they punched it up. Everyone's idea is going to\n\nspk_2 : be better than one person's idea. Come on, guys, chip in, but the bucket of blood, that's! Fucking great! I love it! Print, red room, get fucked!\n\nspk_0 : We closed the red room, it's red on. Also, you read newspapers, will you ridden off? It doesn't work as well when you say it out loud breeds better again, no red's better. Got a grammar deficiency?\n\nspk_2 : So fred's. So the people may know calm kept blasting away at the powerful, to the delight of the working man in Denver one, taking heat was an old architect named ed brooke. He had served in the civil war. Ed brooks sent warnings telling fred to stop his attacks, but that just made fred keep writing the attacks. Ed brooks, ofthis happened across the street from the post, so ed started sitting in his window and cleaning his rifle while staring across\n\nspk_0 : the street. It's. Quite a move.\n\nspk_2 : Wow, we'll stay across the street. Fred suddenly stopped writing about that.\n\nspk_0 : Brooke. Wow, why was that again? Because of the rifle cleaning. Interesting he's, a fucking kick ass architects. It's, like denzel washington, is the architect. No. What?\n\nspk_2 : S o the post under harry and fred was an amazing success. It's ad revenue grew and circulation increased when a friend harry purchased paper in eighteen, ninety five. Circulation was four thousand, so three years later, it was twenty seven thousand. Uh, this is a city of one hundred thirty three thousand. Good merchants in Denver tried to boycott the post, saying ad rates were too high. So the post launched a child labor campaign against the leading department stores in the city of god. Jesus. Well, I mean, who would know more about child labor laws than someone who ran a pub? It eight.\n\nspk_0 : Who was the best bartender in the west? That eleven.\n\nspk_2 : In s o, the people may know, friend, attack the store's, quote. Little girls, poorly dressed with pale faces, are employed in the department stores. Sweatshops, paying a dollar a week to work. Seventy five hours, maybe, okay, in new york, but not in Denver. It's, good for shadowing for the future, though. No. So the merchants quickly back down. Oh, god, this this just help their reputation as looking out for the little guy. When local coal companies refused to drop their prices, prices below five dollars a ton, the post bata coal mine and sold coal for three dollars and seventy five cents a ton. The cold trust then dropped. Their price is too much, harry and fred's, so hurry in, fred. Drop the price to three thirty of time. Harry came up with the slogan, a fulton and an extra lump.\n\nspk_0 : In your liquor, I really should get someone else to do slogans on extra love. Yeah, I got a lump right here. That's, right? We told you an extra lump. Yeah, that's, right. I was going to go with a fulton and a tumor that is catchy.\n\nspk_2 : The other papers in town, controlled by the wealthy, nicknamed harry and fred, not an alum, not run in love, god,\n\nspk_0 : this's, the problem, it's just it's, you can't bring weak shit to this fight. No, you lose, we've just keep seeing it. Yeah, like, i'd know enough,\n\nspk_2 : you got to go hard.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, you gotta go. Art.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, the post attacked high water rates and said the private plant should be public. They went after the man who, when I ran the trams, all this is going on. The post went full on promotion. Crazy. The promotions were endless and insane. They install.\n\nspk_0 : I mean, insane, for this era is very insane.\n\nspk_2 : They installed a siren on the roof of the building, and we just set it off whenever they felt like it. What? Like an air raid, siren knows something like a just a siren's.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, what does that mean, again? Okay, we own a newspaper. Get a bad vibe from them. Just a roof siren never been replicated for some reason. Throws sirens on building totally random, just centre on the officer. You wantto set up the siren. That's. A good idea. More cocaine.\n\nspk_2 : Wants harry had a well known spiritualist drive a two horse carriage through the streets of Denver blindfolded, searching for a hidden needle which the spiritualist found\n\nspk_0 : what oh he's walking about but like, was it also a\n\nspk_2 : needle that they just hit? Like it wasn't like a lost needle, right? Like the whole town of Denver hadn't come together and go on someone's lost this needle. We need a fucking\n\nspk_0 : spiritualists to track it down. Yeah, they stick a needle that they fucking just went and put somewhere on they look, the spirit's knew where it was. Yeah. He actually took up his boss and put it there before it wasn't fucking missing it's in the haystack. I found it\n\nspk_2 : there. There was one needle in Denver what? And and this seamstress lost it on the way to the pharmacy.\n\nspk_0 : What? So they had true they had to bring. I can't tell. So\n\nspk_2 : they had to bring in a spiritualist to find it. And\n\nspk_0 : the only way i'm communicating with the needle it's in grave danger.\n\nspk_1 : Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm\n\nspk_0 : mmm. Put on the siren. This is an emergency. I feel it over here. Good. Yeah. Put the siren on. I'll tell you the blindfold we could have done without cause that would come in super handy.\n\nspk_2 : Obviously, they also had a blindfold. The spiritualist are also wouldn't work because the spiritualist can't find stuff\n\nspk_0 : know for sure. It's, like pin the tail on the donkey\n\nspk_2 : is bastard brother, right? Yeah, so obviously was all set up.\n\nspk_0 : What dead people loved it loved it. Amazing love all brought to you by the post. I know which paper i'm going to read, the one that had that spiritualist five the needle.\n\nspk_2 : One day, people were walking down the street when they looked up to see houdini in a straight jacket, hanging upside down by his feet from a rope attached to the post balcony. I mean, now they're warming up, got houdini in town,\n\nspk_0 : so i'm interested. You know, that paper\n\nspk_2 : never let him down, and that's where he\n\nspk_0 : don't know well, they got the first story, though. Houdini, dad. Oh, no, not now. Don't use the siren now, now, it's for a special occasion, it's crazy. Oh, well, a man is dying. Backwards. Siren. You think this is\n\nspk_2 : another day? People walking down the street were met by cages full of lions\n\nspk_0 : and out of the building. What now? I'm starting to like this paper. Yeah. But it was a lie. It what a friend. I got an idea. Lions in cages just right, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, great, yeah, yeah, well, get hair, ugo yeah, yeah, great shit! Science and cake. Yeah, put the scythe, the scythe. Oh, my god, i'm the siren, ok, that's. Awesome, that's. Awesome that you are the mother fucking side from a man. We have both. Yeah, no, I don't know. Didi. Okay, yeah. Oh, shit. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Actual. What we'll do is okay. What we'll do is we'll throw in some of those lion cages, right? Get rid of the evidence, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, good brainstorm. Is it thursday? I don't believe in days anymore. But we haven't put out the paper in a few days. It could be problematic. Schedule wise. Uh, some days,\n\nspk_2 : fred would prance about on the balcony, holding cloth sacks full of pennies. He grabbed fistfuls and tossed them down onto the street. And men would fight over the loose change. As fred right yelled. Lucky, lucky. The post\n\nspk_0 : brings you luck. Except she leo. The person punched in the street. Jesus christ, yeah, like panning. Oh, my god, I wanted you say that that was the craziest thing. Yeah, because the other things are so crazy. But what he says, I think, tips it for me that really,\n\nspk_2 : if I didn't know better, i'd say we had ourselves a bruce. This million situation.\n\nspk_0 : Lucky, lucky. The post brings you luck. Give me a burning snap that is childhood trauma, though without mother penniless. Now, he's, like i'll show everyone how many pennies I have. For i'm the penniman. Take that batman.\n\nspk_2 : The post really big first don't was to sponsor a statewide beauty contests. Miss marguerite frei one and then the post centre to chicago to take part in a larger contest against other newspapers contestants what an era what goes like it's like the beginning of the misuse a yeah ms frei won that contest too. You want that as well the post bragged about their girl until a post employee blew the whistle. He quit and took the story to the rival news. Apparently miss frey had been forced to sign a contract to turn over all her winnings to fred who in return would give her a job a ten dollars an hour fred had been forced to sign the contract was not told what was in it and after signing was refused to copy well that's how that works normally that's good so yeah yeah good deal good deal for her like she like the prize was like a thousand dollars and he just took it yeah, the art of the deal for sure you didn't have enough money?\n\nspk_0 : No for sure. No, he didn't have enough money yeah that's how you get money\n\nspk_2 : is you just take it from people that's yeah yeah then you'll feel good when they walk through the dressing room while i'll get dressed\n\nspk_0 : well, as long as your public about it that I mean\n\nspk_2 : his lies, your azaleas you just say it and no one cares.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, and then you keep increasing.\n\nspk_2 : The sort of language that you use is faras what you're able to do with your power. And eventually, you're just a rapist, sexual assaulter and and but james gunn gets fired from directing.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, well, no, you just let the apathy slowly soak in. But the problem is, he did it on twitter. Yeah, right,\n\nspk_2 : right. If he had done, if he had done it in real life, totally cool. Yeah, don't you tweet your jokes about that thing\n\nspk_0 : about what we've learned is you can say anything you want on an entertainment bus or twitter. He'll be fine. Yeah. Nice vibe in the room. I\n\nspk_2 : get weird. Some guy rolls literally a few people just saying, there goes. So when\n\nspk_0 : does the purge what's the sirens on?\n\nspk_2 : No, we're so close to the purge. The post moved to a new building on champa street. Someone goes yes. Good. Good, good champ. They had open air shows daily. The entire block was closed off so people could watch. Sometimes the event would last just seconds, like the time vaudevillian act, jean bandini caught a turn up on a fork he held in his mouth. Amane it's, no lions in a cage, it's, no daily. When you did, check it, a turn of the guy's got a fork. Unease, gum. Hold on! Asked me where the turn it came from. I waited at the head of come from.

But as the wagon reach city hall, a wheel came off. Oh, god, it collapsed, fell over onto its side.\n\nspk_0 : David, don't do this\n\nspk_2 : pen broke open, releasing over one hundred dogs\n\nspk_0 : like it? Yes, yes.

I mean, the dogs had a vendetta against\n\nspk_2 : the news by because that fucking siren would set them off.\n\nspk_0 : How did that happen, where they dressed in like top hats? And\n\nspk_2 : they're just smart dogs. These are dogs from the streets now, smart dogs. While all these promotions were going on, fred was blasting the other papers in his column. He said the Denver evening times was on its last legs, a paid shell for corporations that the people no longer read. The owner was for your ius, and he struck back with a story about fred's past the headline read quote. F g bomb fires that's ah kray, liam auto correct f g bomb v's forced to leave kansas city because he swindled poor people the reporting laid out all of fred's lottery and other crimes while in kansas city. The article took a swipe at harry, saying without fred he would be ruined and forced back to the slums from whence he came. The rocky mountain news called the post quote that blackmailing black guarding nauseous sheet which stinks to high heaven and which is the shame of newspaper men the world over. Jesus\n\nspk_0 : well, somebody forgot about the quilt contest pretty fast. What have you done for me lately in the\n\nspk_2 : stunt business? But people love the post.\n\nspk_0 : Of course we did. Where the idiots. Hey,\n\nspk_2 : one of the post most well known reporters was polly pry paulie pride it's a it's, a made up name, but yeah, because she pried into stuff oh, cool firstly, pride pride try it, her price price. Crime dry, like you would pry open a door, you would prime to someone's affairs. You pry open the door, okay, well, both. And then you get into someone's affairs. Their prime affairs,\n\nspk_0 : like the dog's, pry into a mayor's office sort of deal, right, right.\n\nspk_2 : Her first article was about colorado's mental health system titled are insane treatment of the insane nice people love to writing is she decided to do a story about colorado's prison system and was in the canon city prison. Kenya knows him canyon canyon city prison when she met alfred packer. Now, alfred packer had been a prospector who in eighteen eighty five it travelled across the colorado mountains in the middle of winter with five men. It did not go well. Everyone died except alfred, and he ate them.\n\nspk_0 : Know what, alfred. So, thank god his name was alfred paco, el techo. Yeah. The confidence on your faces that look like next way\n\nspk_2 : should give a football this spike.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah. Hey, throw it backwards, though. Yeah. So he just ate everyone. Yeah, and when that happens, it sort of feels like a guy you just like to eat. People went on a hike. Yep, it's like. When did you try to get down? When I was finished eating the gang, I was out of meat. So, hey, we call my gang\n\nspk_2 : the trail mix. Yeah. So he was convicted of killing and eating the men and sentenced to death by hanging. But the colorado supreme,\n\nspk_0 : whose heart just broke for him. Oh,\n\nspk_2 : uh, cannibal or any any, any got off these final meal. And he said, I know where another gang\n\nspk_0 : members, if someone's like, oh, he was hungry. And my only wish is that after I am hanged, i'm allowed to eat myself.\n\nspk_2 : But the colorado supreme court reversed the conviction, as it was based on ex post facto law, which basically means the law didn't exist when he committed the crime. So\n\nspk_0 : they had to invent it for you eating everyone, yeah, basically, you don't get to call dibs. Oh, I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have done it, okay, now I know not to eat twelve of my friends. I think I can admit to him ignorance on this one. I just figured I would eat them, but now I know, you know, try to get down, you know, that's, the next move with them, yeah, who? Well, back to civilian life. I'll walk amongst you.\n\nspk_2 : So al, from was tried again and convicted of manslaughter and\n\nspk_0 : get come on, given forty years, four years. Forty, forty okay, that's, way\n\nspk_2 : better. So, after fourteen years of this sentence, that's, when polly came to the prison and met alfred, she was she. She talked to him, and she decided that he was innocent. So the post took up the cause to get him pardoned.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, no, joe arpaio time.\n\nspk_2 : They hired alfred and attorney ww plug\n\nspk_0 : half way over that he's going to the web site. W w w dot com was hired\n\nspk_2 : is there was hate. T t p colon\n\nspk_0 : class. My assistant invalid server. Oh, my god! So she meets him and she's like you didn't eat those people,\n\nspk_2 : the higher the attorney. Ww plug hat, anderson,\n\nspk_0 : shut your mouth, it's, his nickname plug hat. His nickname is plug hat.\n\nspk_2 : I am assuming your work,\n\nspk_0 : I gotta charge it. Are you related to plug hat easy plug hat?\n\nspk_2 : Because I think it's, a kind of hat, it's applied. Sorry, I assume it's, a kind of hat. I don't think that's a plugs in them. I don't think you can plug up the sharper image catalogue has a bunch of maybe when he puts on the hat ever it's like it's, like a plug. Lot of lot of ways,\n\nspk_0 : a lot of hearsay happening\n\nspk_2 : up here right now, anyway, anderson would be paid one thousand dollars if alfred packer was part. So the post's, la launch stories and editorials, but no one was budging. The governor said he would not pardon alfred under any circumstance.\n\nspk_0 : Not unless one hundred dogs come in here. My word.\n\nspk_2 : So the post war with a new tactic. They printed all the cases of guilty people convicted of crimes like murder and rape, who have been pardoned asking, quote, why not packer? Two days later, it's not intelligible like you. No arguments in your favor, but you take it.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, well, among eating there is also a lot of\n\nspk_2 : murder. Two days later, alfred packer was pearled. What\n\nspk_0 : this is where you're not going to eat any more people if you would let you out, alfred.\n\nspk_2 : He then started hanging around the bucket of blood as sort of a bodyguard weirdo type on and then polly heard that the lawyer anderson had taken alfred alfred is prison funds, which he earned working in the prison, making hair, ropes and bridles. It totaled fifteen hundred dollars. So when polly told fred and harry, harry yelled, quote, we oughta sick packer on him.\n\nspk_0 : You should not say that. What? All right, all right, i'm about he's like curly from the three stooges. They totally know they've got a fucking lunatic release. They know they've got a can of food, not two fucks given like they released a cannibal in there like that. Don't go eat nuts now he'll scamper high five. Don't eat it, don't mouth closed. Close that mouth. There you go. We got a petrified guy you can eat if you want taste like corn.\n\nspk_2 : And then anderson was told he would not be paid the thousand dollars from harry and fred.\n\nspk_0 : It does this upset the cannibal, who just got out of jail.\n\nspk_2 : He's, not there. At the moment, anderson's office was across the street. He put on his silk cat, buttoned up his topcoat and headed for the post. He walked into the bucket of blood, furious harry, immediately\n\nspk_0 : stand hungary's like bucket of blood. Um, who? That's human\n\nspk_2 : grave, irving. Harry immediately started calling anderson a criminal. Anderson jumped his hands on the back of a chair and said, quote, sir, I am a missourian and a man of culture.\n\nspk_0 : Well, that's not. Yeah, I know. Uh huh. Well, you can't be both.\n\nspk_2 : Harry yelled at him, you're not a man at all. You're a low down son of a bitch and a robert, a boot anderson then put his hand into his pocket, and paul yelled, he's got a gun before he could pull it out. Fred was on him, punching him in the face and knocking him down, fred, that got on top of them and started to beat him and was going to beat him to death, but paula yelled at him to stop. She said it would create a scandal.\n\nspk_0 : What she talked to talk, just like you could be like, don't count she's like people will talk about this, the other people's air right about it, you're right. People will just up in my murder and with my hands right now. But I was. I love\n\nspk_2 : that he's, a man who can still be reasoned with at that point.\n\nspk_0 : Actually, you make a compelling argument. I hadn't thought this through. It makes a lot of sense. Plus my hands are starting to\n\nspk_2 : get really, huh? Well, we\n\nspk_0 : could just kill him and eat him\n\nspk_2 : so fred get off anderson and told them to leave. Fred pushed anderson out the door, but the door swung the other way and anderson came back through shooting a gun. The first shot went through fred's shoulder and up into his throat, the second grazed his heart. Fred went down, harry jump behind a desk and started swearing, and anderson\n\nspk_0 : that'll do it a\n\nspk_2 : little. Anderson walked over and shot down, hitting harry in the wrist and shoulder. Paul even stepped over harry and hit him under her skirt. Oh,\n\nspk_0 : well, he's gone.\n\nspk_2 : He was like, this is all right. I don't mind getting shot at this what's goes on keeping your fucking voice down right\n\nspk_0 : now. I love but als. That was my but that's. Why we did that contest, our\n\nspk_2 : boy. She then grabbed the gun, holding the hot barrel anderson stop and calmly walked out of the room in the building. You know,\n\nspk_0 : I should go\n\nspk_2 : he went straight to police headquarters, handed over his gun, saying, quote, arrest me, i'ma murder, i've killed two snakes harry's wounds were more painful than severe, but fred would be recovering for a long time. One bullet was never removed, it was said he never fully recovered and at a hard time sleeping, anderson was put in jail, where he received flowers from the governor with a note that read, I congratulate you upon your intention.\n\nspk_0 : Tough note, too, right? What do I say?\n\nspk_2 : Even after all that, the post would not stop his tabloid ways, like hot and well, local churches were complaining about the content of the post. Harry and fred challenged a group of them to put together the paper one day, and they accepted the headlines were pleasant and pasteurized circulation that day, nose dived. Even the pastor's own flock criticized him for putting out a quote, dull and silly newspaper,\n\nspk_0 : just a little too accurate.\n\nspk_2 : The church leaders, criticisms of the post stopped hey, and fred didn't just attack, though they also made up headlines and stories that were baffling. One classic was, does it hurt to be born?\n\nspk_0 : Completely ignoring the mother's situation. What's the baby going through. Oh, that was hard to get out of who? From shave. Imagine. How do you find out? And what was it like for you? No comment again. Something happens in there. They don't want to talk about. It's. Probably like a\n\nspk_2 : summer camp. The post had the best hustlers on the streets, selling their paper, like burtless collins, who was a blind boxer.\n\nspk_0 : What xbox. Okay, for a second there. How am I doing, he's? Not in the ring yet gassed.\n\nspk_2 : They had the crying newsboy. A child who's stood out in front of the post, everyday arms full of papers, crying from what seemed like the world's worst hard part break people bought the paper because they felt so bad for it. Wow, that guy's the best\n\nspk_0 : eyes, you, jay.\n\nspk_2 : The post encourage the bedlam amongst the newsboys. They would toss out the additions in front of the plate glass press room and watched the boys fight over. The papers\n\nspk_0 : like this is pennies all over again. Quote. Slaughterhouse style, uh, that's. Where things die.\n\nspk_2 : But their success continued. By nineteen o seven. Denver had a population of one hundred seventy thousand. In the post, circulation was eighty three thousand. Wow, more than the combined circulation of the other competing papers. The promotions were in tune with the style of harry. He started a dog and pony show and a tent called flow flow toe, dog and pony show. Why flow toe? Well, a guy in the office had been at last name flatow, and harry loved it.\n\nspk_0 : There is a weird guy, huh? I mean, the\n\nspk_2 : dog and pony show. Does the dog fucked the pony? Order the pony fuck the dog that's, a different dog and pony show that's down in\n\nspk_0 : tijuana, tijuana, tijuana dog a pony. Oh, no, dad, his sound. I mean, it is\n\nspk_2 : adorable. But harry wanted more. He soon increased the show and the opponent more. The post went into the circus business. Let's,\n\nspk_0 : get a lift and get out of here.\n\nspk_2 : But the circus was tough, and they need a name. So they bought. They brought in a partner named cells, cells, cells, cells was from a famous circus family, and they'd sold their circus to ringling. No, no, harry named his new circus, sells flow toe to give it cachet. Cash, eh? And then he used the cells family photo for pr, even though only one member of the cells family was in his circus, only a single cell. So so ringling was furious because he had bought the cells circus for the name and the images of the family. He had bought the whole thing so he could go. The cells are in the circus, so ringling sued, asked for two million, and damages and a restraining order to prevent the cells flow toe circus from using the pr photo of william cells and his family. The battle went outside the court, with ringling's sending men across the country to talk shit about cells, flood, oh, and even damaging the circuses property whenever possible. If cells flood was coming to town, wrangling will put up signs that they would be there the next week, even though they weren't coming. Okay, the circus wars. Okay, the post started calling ringling circus the coming soon. Circus it's. Pretty good.\n\nspk_0 : Compared to other things, I\n\nspk_2 : mean, uh, harry's, brother frank around the circus, which was, despite all this, somehow successful, all that one point, a tiger got out of its cage, left on a pony and then attacked a family and kill the girl. But ana parties. I was adorable. Yeah. Ah, judge ruled for ringling and these cells flood of circus is not allowed to use the cells family photo but could use the name the circus. Would there be a huge money maker? But harry loved it. God also named his favorite elephant. No flow toe got\n\nspk_0 : a floater. So weird phase he's going through it's, perfect for everything also never\n\nspk_2 : gave any money to float, owes this guy in the office like what\n\nspk_0 : the fuck you're everything, uh, fresh.\n\nspk_2 : I love my float over the post kept attacking the rich and politicians they hated, one politician said in a speech. F g bon fees is a public enemy and has left the trail of a slimy serpent across colorado for thirty years. Their feed with ex senator patterson, owner of the rocky mountain news and Denver times kept up just after christmas christmas nineteen seven. Patterson is walking to his papers office. His paper had been attacking fred for several days before christmas as he cut through a lot, he heard good morning paddison turned to reply and was punched in the face.\n\nspk_0 : My god!\n\nspk_2 : He was then hit again, and he fell anything. It was fred. Fred kept hitting him on the ground and yelled, quote, if my name ever appears in your paper again, i'll shoot you like a dog, a groggy patterson said. He wouldn't stop. Fred was arrested. The trial was held on december twenty ninth. A crowd gathered in the courtroom and actually cheered when certain things were testified about\n\nspk_0 : wow, jerry jerry.\n\nspk_2 : I went on for two days with merchants and people in power testify against fred finally he was found guilty and fined fifty dollars oh my god she's hearing fred also had an ongoing feud with Denver mayor robert spear they attacked him relentlessly and called him a puppet of the city's private utilities when a tramp company was given the city contract fred screamed fraud in his column the owner of the tramp companies sued harry and fred for libel. Fred wrote that the judge in the case was already bought and called him a pinhead the judge gave fred sixty days in jails in a five thousand dollar fine. Harry wait he got okay yeah yeah that's right swift justice he beat the shit out of a man the street got a few dollars he called the judge a pinhead got sixty days in a five thousand dollar fine that's right? You got america, right?\n\nspk_0 : Yeah. Good thing that will continue\n\nspk_2 : hair is on vacation in hawaii at the time but he learned when he got back you get the same punishment so when he got back he much right into the court heard the charges and when he was about to be sentenced he yelled at the judge look here judge you and I know this is nothing but a cat dog fight you can put me in jail for twenty years but i'll get you yet the judge was shocked and said case dismissed what?\n\nspk_0 : Who is the honorable judge hussy presiding. It's a brave defense. Yeah, so what you got to go with?\n\nspk_2 : A few years later, fred got into it with thomas o'donnell, who was a corporate attorney currently working for the water department. The water department was looking to renew its franchise with city of Denver the post was against the deal. Oh, donald called the post the black hand. The two men were in the courthouse walking into a courtroom one day when fred said he wasn't scared of o'donnell. Donald said, fred, it never scared him. Fred, that said scare off, huh? Fred, that said, quote, i'm unarmed, but I will go into a room with you and fight it out o'donnell replied. All right, let's, find a room,\n\nspk_0 : I think. There's a conference room on the third floor it's already well move the table gets, um the chairs out of their really open it up for a fight club\n\nspk_2 : fred then punched him in the face.\n\nspk_0 : What about the room?\n\nspk_2 : One of fred's musclemen then grabbed donald from behind, and fred punched away. Neither man ended at present charges. Although fred wanted to put the other guy, didn't he hurt my hand? Even with all these transgressions, the post was still the favorite of the working men of Denver until nineteen twenty, when the streetcar workers went on strike, they demanded higher paying harry and fred for the first time, one against the working man. Fred's column attack them, saying they were being driven by foreign agitators, all union men in Denver one out, angry with the post. On august fifth, the strikers began to riot. Three streetcars were overturned. They fought with cops to strikers, were killed. The mayor asked for citizens to volunteer to help. The riot went on from five pm until after midnight, when someone yelled, quote, let's, get the post! Okay! A mob forming around the building and kids started throwing stones at the large plate glass windows. Soon, houdini. So everyone seemed to be armed with poles, iron bars and shovels. The workers in the post ran away from the windows and then out the rear door, and as they did, the mob stormed into the building. Suddenly, a ladder appeared over the mob in front and leaned against the building, direct access to the bucket of blood. Men, men streamed up the ladder, one ripped out, a water faucet and water gushed out. Then they look to rip every water faucet out to flood the building. That's, how you get him, someone tried to light a fire. Well, that's,\n\nspk_0 : a ridiculous thing to do when you just went everything in the building. Other way around, boys has a way around. We tried to burn it, then we try to drown it if it doesn't work the otherwise gary. Get rid of it. Why is it is tinder lighting\n\nspk_2 : so they try to light the files on fire, but the gushing water put it out. Men then went into the basement, attacked. The printing press is the post office is the post offices were to completely destroyed for over an hour, until the chief lead men, and to stop it, the chief, his head was banished because he had been hit in the head with a brick man. Uh, but the post managed to get the paper out the next day, and fred attacked the mob in the soviets who had influenced them.\n\nspk_0 : Mike, what is going on? The flame,\n\nspk_2 : the russia always gotta be the russians, quote, bolshevism, soviet is.\n\nspk_0 : Why would they do something like that? Wouldn't I? Wouldn't. Play the tape back, you'll hear I meant to say, wouldn't the whole time,\n\nspk_2 : quote, bolshevism, soviet ism and anarchy with gun and torch have leap from bloody and ravish russia to our beloved land, so do not feel sorry for the post. Feel sorry for yourself, for your children, for your country and for civilization, for no man may know who is next on the list. American history is actually just filled with rich people losing battles and using it to say the common man needs to be saved from the left. Anyway, the strikers lost. I mean it's, also a controversial opinion to go after the communist, when your newspaper slogan is most rid. The strike, for a little way, livable wages had failed. Fred blame youths in the city for attacks theater axe instead of the workers who'd always supported, he was totally delusional. They were said to be many well dressed men in the mob. Harry sold the cells flatow circus in nineteen twenty. He was getting older and having no kids, he started talking about giving his money to charity. What one\n\nspk_0 : that I started.\n\nspk_2 : A teapot dome was a place in wyoming. He was on top of one of the richest oil fields in the country, and it was set aside as a naval reserve for oil. The crops secretary of state of the interior, allowed to oilman to get no bid, lucrative leases on the teapot. And at the same time, they fucked another oil man out of a nearby deal costing a million's. Fred was friends with the guy that have been have been fucked out of the deal and began writing about the teapot dome in the post post was the first newspaper in the country to question the leases at teapot dome. He kept investigating and coming up with information that at one point all the involved parties met, including harry and fred. They walked away with a couple hundred thousand and killed the story. But other papers kept at it ensued. Fred and harry had to testify in congress. One senator went after fred until fred yelled, quote, you talk to me as though I was a common criminal.\n\nspk_0 : Yes. Yeah,\n\nspk_2 : it went on like this for some time as the senator's kept pointing out, the post had stopped printing anything about the scandal. Well, for fred claimed it was not true. After the Denver Post praised fred under the headline quote, bon fees exposed huge teapot conspiracy. That's\n\nspk_0 : what ad line?\n\nspk_2 : That's? Not a good headline. I just would have gone with right, said fred. The rocky mountain news made fun of fred's version of events, quote apparently devoid of all shame in any sense of morality. Fred bonds he's, one of the owners of the Denver Post, today put on a bold face and coolly confessed to the senate committee investigating the teapot don't dump oil scandal that he and his partner, hh taman, had shaken down harry f sin claire um, but things got awkward a couple days later when it came out that the news owner had also profited from the scandal course, but it turned out to be one of the biggest candles in american history, and they had killed the story. The american society of newspaper editors formed a committee that issued a report saying fred should be thrown out of the society. He tried to work things behind the scenes to save face, but in the end he resigned from the group. Even with all this, the post continued to do very well. They knew how to put out a paper. People want to read with salacious stories, and people kept buying it and if people bought it advertises would pay for ads. As fred said, quote, a dogfight in a Denver street is more important than a war in europe. I mean, for the dollies. But it was a dog care about the war in fucking europe. You know, men\n\nspk_0 : like much of the prime minister's office. What? Go to parliament? Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! All right. All right. Moment. Harry's. Health had\n\nspk_2 : declined ever since he sold his precious circus in nineteen twenty four. He was diagnosed with cancer and died. He donate half of his fortune to the children's hospital. And the other half went to his wife. Fred was now alone at sixty three. In nineteen twenty eight, fred declared in the post that he was putting all of his fortune into the frederick g bomb fees foundation for the betterment of mankind.\n\nspk_0 : That's. Nice that's. Now it'll be interesting to see what that charity does with that money\n\nspk_2 : for the betterment of mankind. No one could figure out what it meant. There was no explanation. It was just a thing. Sure. What's whatever. Fred bought a room in the fairmount cemetery. Muslim which cost thirty thousand dollars. Nice that's. Good. Teo, get those accommodations right for your corpse. Fred died in february nineteen thirty three after coming down with the flu, which turned into pneumonia at the time is the state was worth an estimated twenty million dollars. How, uh,\n\nspk_0 : how's that bullshit built. There are just a lot of parallels\n\nspk_2 : there, like the first tabloid guys.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, I think we all felt like there was a second half to that sentence. But I guess, leave them wanting more that's. What they say, right, name is, they're the first ones. Well, I will say this.\n\nspk_2 : I'm right there with you, man, no collusion. I'm right there with you. Oh, boy, that's tough. Anyway, they were cool. You got some cool people in your town.\n\nspk_0 : It is so similar to the way that we get\n\nspk_2 : our fixed now, from the sensationalism of the shit that's happening. What?\n\nspk_0 : No, no, sorry. I'm going to point out the parallels in what you've prepared. Uh, but we would we enjoy that so much more than the boring truth. You'd rather the wild bull shit than the boring truth always, and that\n\nspk_2 : just, you know, it doesn't seem to be working out great. No it's going great, you know? No, it isn't is fucking awesome right now. What what's wrong in this country? Oh, boy! Things were great. Mmm. Uh,\n\nspk_0 : what do you have a good feeling\n\nspk_2 : about right now? Schumer is great shuman.\n\nspk_0 : Amy schumer. Yeah, no, it's great. Her uncle, uh, her uncle chuck,\n\nspk_2 : her uncle, chuck he's,\n\nspk_0 : the spokesmen for good posture, a chuck schumer, the man whose head is buried in his sternum. The man who were like you must have the spine to fight this. While he's, just like what I had was to dry at lunch. I forget what I was fighting\n\nspk_2 : for. You know where that guy like him. And then we yeah, uh, sharing up. We're not. We're not arresting irish immigrants. There you are, swedish or norwegians, or dutch or english or what's happening. Right now, i'm just think of all the people were not arresting. But the mexicans are in cages anyway. Russia. Russia russia, russia, russia, russia. Kids are in cages. Russia, russia, russia. Hey, kids are in cages. Russia, russia, russia. Hey, that's, what the nazis did. Rush.\n\nspk_0 : Okay. Oh, my god, we're just so fun! This would be a really good time for someone in the audience to release one hundred dogs. Well, we know a finnish way. Thank you very much, guys. We appreciate it so much. Thank you.

The greens married just five days before the birth.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, and what I think we all know what that means.\n\nspk_0 : He didn't want\n\nspk_2 : what what?\n\nspk_0 : Never mind, yeah. After the birth, irene's, vital signs dipped, too scary levels. She was taken into intensive care. They didn't have time to name the baby. Three days later, she died of an enlarged heart. Gets all the sweeties got big yeah,\n\nspk_2 : and so the baby was just they were like baby green,\n\nspk_0 : right? So it's named baby green in the night.\n\nspk_2 : And what about the father?\n\nspk_0 : Well, after the funeral, john green finally named the baby daniel after his grandfather.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, okay, not sure what's happening here, but\n\nspk_0 : okay, so john was having a hard time. He started drinking a lot,\n\nspk_2 : okay, large liver that he was also dealing with whose damn it. We just can't get regular sized organs.\n\nspk_0 : He wanted his, his liver to go up in heaven with\n\nspk_1 : my love, my liver, to pop like our heart. Come on, morgan.\n\nspk_0 : He lost his job as a traveling salesman for the fuller brush company for drinking.\n\nspk_2 : She dave, this is yeah, for the time, I imagine, quite depressing. Traveling brush salesman lose his wife to drinking. You're like\n\nspk_1 : what I have\n\nspk_2 : don't come in here, son, daddy's, weeping over his brushes again. I love your boy.\n\nspk_1 : Feel my liver isn't moving. I think it whispered killed\n\nspk_2 : me the other night.\n\nspk_0 : He couldn't take care of his son. So he placed danny at age of six in the palmdale catholic orphanage. God. That's, one of the best age is to give up a kid.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, six and one of the best people that put the future of your children in the hands of catholics absolutely free with children. Yeah, no honor. System's been working just fine. Yeah,\n\nspk_0 : wave. The catholics have the best orphanages, particularly in ireland. They do a really nice job there. But danny went back to live with his dad after his dad got remarried. Okay, s\n\nspk_2 : so you got his life to get how long's in the orphanage.\n\nspk_1 : Then I couldn't\n\nspk_0 : find that, but okay. Hey, did not get along with his new stepmother and ran away several times. Okay? Not it wasn't. I mean, once he was found in our neighbor's porch. So it wasn't like,\n\nspk_2 : oh, it's like the runaways that I used to pull off, you know, the one where you're just like goodbye forever, lady and then you're like, i'm in the\n\nspk_1 : tree. Why doesn't she give a fuck? I mean, this is this's it saying she's literally making tea and they're this asshole I said goodbye forever and she's back in have its codes. You know, I have half a mind to move back in just to give her a piece of\n\nspk_2 : my half mind.\n\nspk_1 : Hey, lady, moved on pretty fast, didn't you? I can see you. Oh, well, this time i've\n\nspk_2 : got for riel under the neighbor's porch\n\nspk_1 : and she fucking watching tv. Hello?\n\nspk_2 : Hello. Yeah, that's. What it would have been\n\nspk_1 : no coffee. I saw you under there, garvey.\n\nspk_0 : So dad couldn't take it anymore, and he's sent danny to live with his grandfather. Jesus. Okay, they lived in a small house in the heart of collinwood and the okay. Are you\n\nspk_1 : from collinwood? What's? It called. You know, no, I think\n\nspk_0 : I think nothing's changed. I'm gathering that nobody wants to be from there, it's like a gritty industrial, or was now I imagine it's, just all empty pink fairies, the factory's there still jobs there. No, it's\n\nspk_1 : gentrified isn't really yes, fuck the poor.\n\nspk_0 : Now, it's now and that's. Not even doing picture in my mind, I picture like a factory's, been turned into a brewery and there's, a lot of beards and mustaches. Okay,\n\nspk_2 : still getting pushed back there like no dave, your second vision. Also wrong.\n\nspk_0 : All right, so I don't give a shit anymore, but\n\nspk_2 : and so say about dave, he'll give you two visions that's it out to andy's out,\n\nspk_0 : so back on the day it was a gritty, industrial irish neighborhood. Okay. In the nineteen forties, common became one of the most heavily industrialized areas in the entire nation. Children played near the railroad yards or the many factories spewing pollution's, getting very beautiful picture. Sure, yeah, it's, gorgeous. His grandfather worked nights on end and then slept all day. So danny was pretty much unsupervised.\n\nspk_2 : It's just not the best thing for in about no, no, no that's,\n\nspk_1 : the\n\nspk_0 : best thing for a child and has lost his mom now you basically it isn't. The child is like he died because of me now and then. On top of that, the dad was like, I like booze bow than you and\n\nspk_2 : it's. Not a good thing. You know the best. Yeah, you know, in city, when you're like, I missed the catholics. At least they paid me some attention in the wrong ways. Doing confession is a kid you like, which one's in there because I don't want to blow up his spot. Oh, it's, you. Oh, nothing. Then\n\nspk_0 : first, I confessed to you. Then you confessed to me.\n\nspk_2 : I'll be a while, my boy.\n\nspk_0 : He went to catholic school. I rarely did. His schoolwork always got into trouble. That's what? He bothered to go to school? He's not well. Care for cared for. A friend said he was always dirty. Interesting that's a good\n\nspk_2 : thing. That's. What? You definitely want to be on a list of things people recollect about you filthy boy. Disgusting, dirty child. The one with flies around him.\n\nspk_0 : You like pranks. But the lie between cruelty and funny was often blurred.\n\nspk_2 : Well, as is to be part of the thing with frank sometimes.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah. Hey was in the boy scouts for a total of three weeks, but was kicked out for giving the scoutmaster ah, hotfoot.\n\nspk_2 : Ah, hot foot. Yeah. It's\n\nspk_0 : when you you know, set like,\n\nspk_2 : oh, you light is yeah, right when you light a shoe on fire. So\n\nspk_0 : I was in the boy scouts for I think, a month. And then I beat up the dead mother's son. So what for\n\nspk_2 : a merit badge? Yeah, yeah, not\n\nspk_0 : one. Danny wasn't afraid to fight, which he had to do a lot in collinwood. Irish kids were targeted by italian and slovenian boy jesus, those fucking slovenians. You know what i'm\n\nspk_2 : saying, slippery slovaks, that's what we call him\n\nspk_0 : on the high school, he excelled at baseball and basketball. So the nuns and priests gave him leeway. Okay, they also seem to like him. He ended up going to three different high schools and was expelled from all of them.\n\nspk_2 : Wait, what do you mean? They seem to like him, though they liked him, but he kept getting expelled.\n\nspk_1 : I think he's\n\nspk_0 : very charismatic. So they liked him. But he was also\n\nspk_2 : right. Like this isn't easy for us, but another one of your pranks cross the line. Okay, two people have drowned, so that is not that's. What we're saying, you know, it's not funny anymore.\n\nspk_0 : I get it like it was a funny\n\nspk_2 : idea. Got its killing us because you are an angel and that's coming from may who talks to god, you know, and god, you are an angel. But we're this is we have to bid you a do again because two lives have been taken by your tomfoolery popped out. Yeah, said to\n\nspk_0 : heaven. So that's a plus\n\nspk_2 : I have to believe me that you it's like you're quoting me when I talk to the superintendent, I said, you know, I would love to go up there, but yeah. Well, what, you bring it in one last time? Let's have a slow, long one. Come on. Come on.\n\nspk_0 : So the last time he was kicked out of high school, he was a senior, is eighteen, so we just joined the marines, okay, what you do? Sure, oddly, discipline was a problem in the marine,\n\nspk_2 : really, for him, but his background,\n\nspk_0 : I know, but he had a lot of talent as a boxer and was a very gifted shooter, okay, the gold gun sure eventually became of firearms, instructor in the sheriff who's, good with a weapon. He served three years and a night, eighteen, fifty three, was promoted to corporal and then honorably discharged. Okay, danny went back to cleveland and worked at the rail yard. There he met june tears, june\n\nspk_2 : tears, baby green, met june tears, his name's, danny. Now, yeah, I know, but he'll always be baby green to me, david.\n\nspk_0 : They quickly married and divorced in two and a half years\n\nspk_2 : to go on a fun run.\n\nspk_0 : He'd been married. Nancy helder, i'm sorry.\n\nspk_1 : Where is he\n\nspk_2 : going, tio here, it funny names will match you with anyone.\n\nspk_1 : Funny names,\n\nspk_2 : matchmakers. Get over it. What\n\nspk_1 : was her name?\n\nspk_0 : Nancy helder, nancy. Okay, so they married a month later, after the first divorce. Sure, wright was a little bit less than a month. It was like twenty eight days.\n\nspk_2 : Well, that's, plenty of time, they say it takes two and a half weeks to get over a divorce. That's, right?\n\nspk_0 : In nineteen fifty seven, he started working on the docks as a long short. Okay, got that going? Sure, Cleveland waterfront was booming. I assume it's still is great waterfront tremendous waterfront at lots of water. Tremendous. Yeah. Danny was ah, lazy worker. He was okay. He once got fired for sleeping on duty in the ship's hold.\n\nspk_2 : We've all been there day after a couple drinks. Okay, so he fell asleep in a shit hole. Yeah. Is that hard to do? That feels almost sort of\n\nspk_1 : like you would get in there\n\nspk_0 : you'd be like, oh, it's rocking a little bit. I'm tired, super hungover look there's some grain and then you're out,\n\nspk_2 : right? All right, if you say so, it's,\n\nspk_0 : how I picture it\n\nspk_2 : know you're the doctor. I'm\n\nspk_0 : listening hey was very popular with his fellow dock workers. He had a very charismatic personality and was fearless. He rubbed he'd like to rub sun tan lotion on his chest face before going out into this sun on the docks. All right, on one day another longshoremen made fun of danny as he was putting on the lotion. So danny knocked him out with one punch\n\nspk_2 : so he gets all lotion company's fighting out there, I guarantee there's a couple of guys are like,\n\nspk_0 : don't stop him the local international longshoreman association union was taking off as imports flooded it. More and more men were being hired. In nineteen sixty one, danny ran for and was easily elected president of the iowa local thirteen, seventy. It just\n\nspk_1 : doesn't feel like he's ready for this position every like at no point, we haven't had this like growth\n\nspk_2 : spurt of attitude yet where all of the sudden i'm like, oh, this moment, i'll change him, he's still just suntanning up on beating the fuck out of people, another, like\n\nspk_1 : you run the ship now. I don't think he's over june he's not gonna, can I be honest? I just don't think he's gotten over\n\nspk_2 : june. I think this is all about her.\n\nspk_1 : I think i'm going to find\n\nspk_0 : in this story that danny doesn't have a big turn as muchas danny tries to bend the will of the world, teo.\n\nspk_2 : Interesting, interesting, interesting, sort of ah, right,\n\nspk_0 : um, so he's, president of local thirteen seventeen, where\n\nspk_1 : i'm a thirteen. Seventeen,\n\nspk_2 : is the floor women up there, and you are sure mints.\n\nspk_0 : A year later, he was elected district vice president of the great lakes office of the island, so he's fucking killing it. Sure, he was also super into being irish.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, no, that's, not a great quality, as we found out from our actual personal experience, those who are passionate about irish\n\nspk_1 : don't like a joke.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, boy, do they not. Yeah, are you saying I fought\n\nspk_1 : contact? Footy?\n\nspk_0 : He decided, turn the union office, do a presentable front for being for union related business, who's going to try and fix it up a little bit, right, wait,\n\nspk_2 : what do you mean? That sounds shady?\n\nspk_1 : We\n\nspk_0 : bring in guys that meetings and stuff, you want to have a nice office,\n\nspk_2 : okay, but okay, this is clearly shady,\n\nspk_0 : say, painted the interior walls green.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, no, he's, that guy now get a green desk. Jesus, that\n\nspk_1 : was not easy to find. He used green pens. He had this thing, the riddle. Er, yeah, the union. He had the union\n\nspk_0 : bylaws re printed in green ink, and he beim what if he bought a green cadillac?\n\nspk_1 : I mean, dave, what? Yeah, I get it, you're irish guys who worked in the office had to wear green jacket like they just won the masters, a\n\nspk_2 : whole bunch of people walking around the green office. Well, then, when the second you get hired, oh, yeah, and we'll get you the green jacket, thie other thing, don't ever talk about the irish in a disparaging fashion. This is all a testament to what he likes to feel like. He lives in a clover, he's, very serious about being irish. Well, we've got to start pissing green. Sure, sir, absolutely. We will figure out a way to get that done. Absolutely.\n\nspk_0 : Danny started hosting parties after cleveland browns games,\n\nspk_2 : but he was just like, you mean the Cleveland greens.\n\nspk_0 : The party's became a thing, and soon local bigwigs were coming.\n\nspk_2 : Bigwigs, a judges, cops, mobsters, towns, villages. Okay, all right, just a weird party, judge.\n\nspk_0 : And danny wasn't shy about talking to the press he told the reporter quote before I got here union headquarters was a packing crate in a light bulb on a cord\n\nspk_2 : boone was a packing crate with a lightbulb on corn on a cord on a court okay corn no I will either once shitty corn is weirder for porn it's like a weirder angle absolutely okay, so the press is interested in him because he's just a bit of a party animal right? Okay\n\nspk_0 : his is a very tough advocate for his men and was always going to war with the stevedoring companies. Okay, the companies want to pick who worked loading and unloading ships okay danny fought them on that to enforce his will he formed an inner circle of ex boxers and gangsters who threatened or beat up opponents like stevedoring company management business agents or even fellow dock workers.\n\nspk_2 : So yeah okay pretty obvious what's going on what? Nothing it's just a guy doing business stacking the deck\n\nspk_0 : one of danny's henchman quote if someone complained they'd get a beating is\n\nspk_1 : this all I even know the first code of being a henchman you shut the fuck up.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, we do whatever we kick everyone's ass because he's the best we love green now, thomas,\n\nspk_0 : if someone went to the police that get a beating.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, i'm noticing a pattern.\n\nspk_0 : Even if one of them just said something bad about danny he'd get a beating. Danny named his enforcers the grievance committee.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, my god! Day! I haven't watched a lot of wrestling, but there is no doubt the grievance committee could be entering the ring before danny. And here we are tonight, the grievance committee, coming out there, taking no nonsense. You know, the grievance committee works. Is danny's coming out and he's getting\n\nspk_1 : a hot dog started grievance\n\nspk_2 : committee taking care of this guy, showing him a thing or two, giving him the what's. What? Pulling the ropes apart. Grievance committee. Danny walks in hi hi, and today danny will be fighting awkward j. Awkward j weighing in at one hundred nine pounds works at a blockbuster hi. Yeah is thing is just saying hello a few different ways,\n\nspk_1 : all right? Hey. Okay. Not sure if this guy\n\nspk_2 : knows what's going on, he is about to enter a wrestling match and he's just really kind of big sweet about it. Ref comes out, make sure both fighters understand what over clearly\n\nspk_1 : doesn't and that's the bell and it's off on j still just say, hey,\n\nspk_2 : danny, not sure what to do the grievance committee freaking out the corner they're looking to tap someone in here get figure this situation out this guy's just a little\n\nspk_1 : too earnest. Okay, bye. I don't think he understands what rounds are or wrestling he's actually exiting the ring grievance\n\nspk_2 : committee, filling out paperwork in a furious rate. Oh, no, they're\n\nspk_1 : bringing in the notary, the notary's here, the notary's overlooking the grievance committee paperwork he's signing off the grievance committee of official official claims boy gang. I'll tell you what, there's. Not a lot of blood on\n\nspk_2 : the mat but it's really fun to see how the sausage gets made.\n\nspk_0 : It's! That's. What it's actually like. Now there were lots of assaults being donner on Cleveland by longshoremen. Sure, which agreements committee reported to police on policemen, dead, co. Vasic was a police supervisor of the time. He was one of the cops who went down to talk to danny about all these longshoremen assaults.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, right,\n\nspk_0 : um, quote, we weren't prepared for what we ran into. Their waiting there. And that car pulls up and it's. Yeah, danny's being chauffeured around by two long sharman one open the car door, and danny got out wearing a men's white fur coat that was belted at the waist.\n\nspk_1 : So he's, connor\n\nspk_2 : mcgregor at this point. And he's getting out of the green machine. I'm assuming right? It has to be\n\nspk_0 : definitely get out of the green.\n\nspk_2 : If you get that, you swing it around.\n\nspk_0 : But, I mean, how bad ass are you with the white fur coat belted at the waist?\n\nspk_1 : Dave, I think there is a fine\n\nspk_2 : line and some compote. Like ticket name, if you know. Yeah, yeah. There are a few people when they do it. Like okay, yeah, yeah. He's dangerous. He'll wear fur in public, so he's ready melted for belted for the belt belt.\n\nspk_0 : So so they all went in the union office, quote. We walked into a cia green. The desk was green, the walls were green. He\n\nspk_2 : was guys, put these green bags on your head with the grievance committee,\n\nspk_0 : the cop as danny for help with the assaults. But he just started bitching about the italians. Interesting. Interesting retort and quote used every ethnic slur I could imagine. Danny still hated the italians from his childhood. Okay, being esso, he just basically didn't do anything about\n\nspk_2 : right. Yeah, no, that's. Why we're so yeah, it's. Like trying to talk to the president. I mean obama. Sorry to be clear. Boom!\n\nspk_1 : Being a\n\nspk_0 : union official brought danny to new levels of power in cleveland's world of politics, labor and crime. Hey, hung out with well known underworld at a well known underworld nightspots on\n\nspk_2 : underworld nightspots like vampire hangout. Well,\n\nspk_0 : yeah, this is sort\n\nspk_2 : of like the beginning of blade, vampire. Yeah, right. Ok, so he said some sort of e d m sort of vampire club where they're shape shifters, lizard people, vampires, that's. Right. Well, the swear types. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay. So he's hanging out at that october thirty\n\nspk_0 : first. And this is where he became aware. Well,\n\nspk_2 : o okay. Interesting.\n\nspk_0 : So he'd hang out at these places in these meeting gangsters. This is where he met alex shaw. Nder burns. He met him at the theatrical bar and grill\n\nspk_2 : theatrical bar and grill. It feels like, okay, it feels a little okay.\n\nspk_0 : Uh, shawn er, shot of burns was a jewish gangster who had been around since the days of prohibition. He had also been in an orphanage as a child. That was after his mother died when this still they had in their apartment exploded.\n\nspk_2 : Jesus! That'll happen. Minds. Heart popped, but that's a crazy story.\n\nspk_0 : Burns has started out as a newsy and had worked all the way all the way up to having a thriving loan. Sharking and numbers. Operation that's. Nice,\n\nspk_1 : it's. Nice to\n\nspk_2 : see a rise out of the news. He ranks american success story. Yeah, a loan sharking.\n\nspk_0 : So danny kept a pistol in his desk, and we used the union.\n\nspk_2 : A green one, right? Yep, yeah, obviously.\n\nspk_0 : And at night, he would use the union office for practice target shooting. What\n\nspk_2 : baby green, no bad baby green.\n\nspk_1 : It was during this\n\nspk_0 : period that danny became an fbi informant. Oh, my god, yeah, okay, denny saw it more as what the fbi could do for him than what information he could give the fbi\n\nspk_2 : interesting that's, an interesting way of looking at it.\n\nspk_0 : Um, so he just kept at it. He would declare work stoppages, too, show companies who controlled the docks, and then the rank and file became openly hostile toward the companies. Things would often get violent, and danny's men would shoot out lights in a warehouse or smash windows. One time gums. Gunshots caused a german freighter to turn around and leave before it was unloaded.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, my god! Man, what\n\nspk_1 : year is this?\n\nspk_0 : This is, like late sixties,\n\nspk_2 : okay, all rights after the germans, like we\n\nspk_1 : don't do that anymore. Oh, switch decades now. The tree\n\nspk_0 : it's, early sixties, eso another time, danny threatened to murder the children of a company owner, so the fbi had to put the man's house and family under protection.\n\nspk_1 : Is the fbi still working with him? Yeah, they're like,\n\nspk_2 : look, danny, come on, that's,\n\nspk_1 : what I do owe you guys knew when you got into business with me, it's, my thing.\n\nspk_2 : Look, we're sick of going to the grievance committee. We don't feel like they're sending you our grievances. They're\n\nspk_1 : not writing a lot of it down. What i'm trying to smash a chair over, ed, fuck\n\nspk_0 : it, yeah, danny's salary was only six thousand dollars a year, huh? Sure, but he was\n\nspk_1 : living quite the life\n\nspk_2 : weird, because on six thousand a year, one would think that that wouldn't be easy. No, okay. He loves green\n\nspk_0 : he's, thrown down money at clubs, driving his green cadillac grounds, plenty left over for his wife and two dollars, daughters, as well as a mistress on the side. His lifestyle was not Cleveland desk. Hey! Seriously,\n\nspk_1 : yeah, yeah.\n\nspk_0 : You guys want to get into this now. Danny. Increased dues. Twenty five percent good. May workers put in overtime hours on a grain ship. Can\n\nspk_1 : you\n\nspk_2 : imagine someone getting away with that now?\n\nspk_0 : Telling them money was going to build a new fund. So he has them working overtime hours on this ship and then all the money from that, they're not getting it's going to a fun to build a new building for the\n\nspk_2 : fund to build a new building\n\nspk_0 : for the office of the new office building\n\nspk_2 : a new for his new office\n\nspk_0 : building for the union for\n\nspk_2 : the union. Right?\n\nspk_0 : No. Turns out danny was just taken. That\n\nspk_1 : was weird. Yeah, baby. Danny, baby green. Yeah, well, baby, great\n\nspk_0 : baby. Great man. Workers who wouldn't work on the grain ship were fired more than fifty. Danny told other members those guys were, quote, y nos and bums. All right? I didn't realize that. So, yeah, thats one worker had been off the job for a year because he lost a leg.\n\nspk_2 : That's. A very fair reason. The\n\nspk_0 : doc the doc. So hard place. Yeah. Just go ahead and that'll come right off.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, you're allowed to take a year. Maybe longer, maybe more. Yeah, maybe forever.\n\nspk_0 : When he came back, he was amazed at the brazenness of danny scam. He was also married to a plane's dealer newspaper reporter. Okay. Plain dealer. All right, well, what do you do, it's a thing. Everybody, settle down. Now, please. Here. So, that's, what we're calling it. What do you what do you what's? Your objection, sir?\n\nspk_2 : I don't feel like that was the same person who had a complaint, but it will take it. What that's, the man who thinks that the ipads on it,\n\nspk_0 : what happened there? Wass ah, hero rose up.\n\nspk_2 : No it's already in the ipad. God, that guy. One rose to the occasion. No, it doesn't\n\nspk_0 : matter. It's, already in the the one they've waited for?\n\nspk_1 : No. Don't do this. Never forget you. Who?\n\nspk_0 : So the paper started looking into this story. The paper. Yeah. That's, right? On then they dropped the story, and an fbi investigation was begun. Okay, they came in, they took records from the union office,\n\nspk_1 : say, there's. The rolling stones\n\nspk_2 : albums were taken, these,\n\nspk_0 : and they discovered that the union office has been bugged during the remodel. So all that time, he was bugging his own guys so he could learn everything that was going on.\n\nspk_1 : Okay, so how do you s\n\nspk_2 : so if you're him, you gotta pretend like you have no idea,\n\nspk_1 : we're bugged. Oh, my god, they heard everything looked like everyone else said, look at my face.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, sons of bitches and a you think I don't notice, too, because I was shooting holes in the walls the whole time. It's. Such an invasion. You\n\nspk_0 : know, the day the bugs were found, someone jove by danny's house and fired shots into the wall. Okay, danny wasn't home at the time. His wife and kids were a reporter came by and asked nancy where danny was what he was doing. And nancy said, quote, his irish is.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, what a great way to describe it. You know what it means? Yeah, doesn't leave it, leave it alone, is here. His irish is up. Oh, god, all right, well, let me know when he goes back down to regular levels.\n\nspk_1 : That's that's it from danny greene's house. His irish is up back to you, bob. Yeah.\n\nspk_0 : Danny resigned from his positions in the union and was indicted for embezzling thirty five thousand dollars and falsifying records in nineteen sixty six. He was convicted and sentenced to five years.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, here's. Where? Yep, exactly. But he\n\nspk_1 : served an hour. Yeah,\n\nspk_0 : but the sentence was suspended because it was his first offense.\n\nspk_1 : Well, in what fucking work, man? At what point? We just need a clear judiciales is, like, just clear sucking. What happens? What happens if you do the thing? Not what kind of mood is\n\nspk_2 : the judge in? Well, but I also do like that green cars. Um, janet ever to go.\n\nspk_1 : You can next up. Non\n\nspk_2 : white guy. Mmm.\n\nspk_1 : You could do. You could do it. You could do a\n\nspk_0 : dollop just on the f b I and every single time a b and then the fbi got involved that everything got all fucked up. Yeah, right. Because it's pretty pretty consistent that they do this kind of shit and then go after people haven't done anything. So\n\nspk_2 : so you're saying that for the general state of affairs of today, we should all feel really good.\n\nspk_0 : There's. A japanese movie. I can't remember the name of it, but there's. A scene where there's, a bunch of guys fighting from two different sides, and someone says, what should we do? And the guys has let them fight fbi. Trump let him fight. We're not on either side. Yeah, they're all\n\nspk_2 : bad. Rooting for injuries. Who do you want to win? I just want a lot of guys to get banged up.\n\nspk_0 : So, right. So then, sense is suspended because his first offense than the court of appeals overturns the for a technicality. So they go. They can go back to trial, but he ends up pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges of falsifying union records. He got a fine and was barred from working in labor business for five years.\n\nspk_2 : Well, quite a fucking turn around thirty five grand, especially if the way that he's working in the labor business doesn't seem, too, doesn't seem to actually need him to be employed by labor. I mean, he's corrupt. He just needs a front. There we go. The grievance committee is like sugar, miss you, plus what\n\nspk_1 : you wait five years to use the c word,\n\nspk_0 : you say, corrupt it's, a crypt about danny. No. Yeah, it sounds like you said danny might be corrupted, so I thought, I\n\nspk_2 : just don't want to get beat up again. Danny bugged me.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, i'm here, and\n\nspk_2 : he put a bug in me.\n\nspk_0 : What i'm hearing right now, i'm hearing a grievance. You know what I mean?\n\nspk_2 : Oh, no. One night only the grievance committee is back without danny, who will notarize. The notary. This is actually just a ceremony where paperwork will again be filled out. We want to be clear,\n\nspk_0 : man. I got a big one. Signature\n\nspk_2 : easy, uh, clarify what you mean. It's. A podcast.\n\nspk_0 : You know, no, it probably hurt that he's, an fbi snatcher for all this stuff we got away with. Anyways, union official days are over moving on, so he starts a new business called emerald industrial relations.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, sure, sure, like ruby fucking. Now,\n\nspk_1 : for a\n\nspk_0 : fee, his consulting firm, huh? Yeah, would offer protection to companies against union issues.\n\nspk_1 : That dave that's,\n\nspk_2 : a funny, a plight,\n\nspk_0 : also supply problems and work stoppages. So and he sort of issue in that area. He issues. I guess, if you were\n\nspk_2 : to try to put it into one category, sort of, you know, issue's unions deal with.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, well, also issues that danny would then create, right, so he would. He would create work stoppages or supply problems, and then be like, hey, if you pay me,\n\nspk_2 : i'll figure out a way to fix this. If\n\nspk_1 : you pay me, the thing that i'm doing is going to stop. Hey,\n\nspk_0 : got a load of glass, held up at a dock on the company, brought him two thousand dollars to get it released. Companies thought it was easier to just pay the fee than to fight it. It is hundred percent plus, if anyone gave danny trouble, he had one of his guys blow up a car or a business as a warning. Is this christ? Yeah, he took it up a notch with green fire. If the bombing got on the news, danny would give this guy a bonus.\n\nspk_2 : But a bonus was a flogging. The news\n\nspk_0 : that danny had a bar bombed because the bar owner was a union official who had opposed jim jesus, what do we gotta do? I don't know, Cleveland police charged danny with labor wreck a tearing\n\nspk_1 : yeah, but it's only a second offense. Oh my god, I mean, how many times are we going toe? Blame this poor guy, dance the world around him\n\nspk_2 : that has created this villainous\n\nspk_0 : right he's just doing he's, just a\n\nspk_1 : guy working for god, sees a kid who's in his forties. He's a fucking child. It was his baby green to may he's, a widow, baby. He doesn't know no bad. Oh, but there's a great is a great\n\nspk_0 : example of how the government doesn't support small businessmen.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah. Yeah, true.\n\nspk_0 : So danny has this barb on the police, charging with labor, racketeering and violating his parole.\n\nspk_1 : And what about bombing? Is that on the list?\n\nspk_0 : Well, it doesn't matter, because the judge threw out the charges and gave no explanation.\n\nspk_1 : S o, you have free to go\n\nspk_2 : well, danny, I think I speak for everyone when I say, i'm really sorry we should not have been so rude to you.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, this was on us,\n\nspk_2 : by the way, there's, two judges,\n\nspk_1 : no one. Hold on now, officer, would you\n\nspk_0 : apologize to danny for what you put him through?\n\nspk_2 : Hi, danny. I'm just so sorry. I don't know. Well,\n\nspk_1 : look at him in the eyes,\n\nspk_2 : jenna. I don't know what we're thinking. We're so stupid. And i'm\n\nspk_0 : all right now. Suck his dick.\n\nspk_2 : It will be an honor.\n\nspk_0 : At that's, a leper con right there, and then you get the lepic. Ah, go on! It turns out that j edgar hoover himself,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, the body.\n\nspk_0 : Danny was a good guy to have out on the street. Snitching. Jacob man was pulling the strings for the fbi. It was\n\nspk_2 : like dick tracy the green, okay, so\n\nspk_0 : so in the nineteen sixties, the garbage business started to become a moneymaking operation.\n\nspk_2 : Well, that's, the business he's already been working in, to be fair,\n\nspk_0 : is full of it. Anyway. Small ways telling firms were opening up all over. If there is money, the mob was involved, the new york mob had taken over the garbage business in new york, and now the Cleveland mob want to take over the Cleveland garbage. Okay, first day they had to infiltrate the Cleveland solid waste trade guild.\n\nspk_1 : I mean, what, like, what kind of\n\nspk_2 : mall are you sending in to die? Nebraska, the waste people, you know, what can I say? I'm just excited to get involved with some of the solid waste.\n\nspk_0 : Well, it's, nice to have your baba is a bob.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, yeah, bob regular. Yeah, yeah, just my my pa was a garbage guy. My grandpa was a garbage guy. I'm a garbage guy, too.\n\nspk_0 : That's. Great. Yeah, we all love garbage here. Well,\n\nspk_2 : ah, nobody loves it more than may. I'm regular, just like you guys. Okay? Yeah, hundred percent let's. Get to it. Bend over and pick up that pilot shit. Bend over.\n\nspk_0 : Don't make that noise.\n\nspk_1 : It's. A terrible noise.\n\nspk_2 : Meant to intimidate you.\n\nspk_0 : So the good news is that danny's five year ban from the union business had just ended.\n\nspk_2 : Thank god he can finally get\n\nspk_0 : involved again. So the mob look to danny, he and his ah, main bob got a bomb guy bob. He and his main bomb guy got involved, and I brought in a friend of danny's named mike fratto. Okay, danny and mike were so close, they named their sons after each other. Super weird, super, super weird. I am danny. This is my son, mike fratto.\n\nspk_2 : And i'm like, fredo, this is my boy, danny. This fall on cbs, we will be living in a duplex. The\n\nspk_1 : show's called two names.\n\nspk_2 : Two houses. It's already been cancelled. Scam\n\nspk_0 : mike was already making a million a year in the garbage business stays in politics. Danny, explain the job, quote if others don't don't join the gil that we will follow their trucks and take away their stops, will offer to pick up for less and take away their business at the cheapest price and knocked them out of the box. There are a lot of ways we can do this. And then we'll split up the stops and give them to the guild members. Who's\n\nspk_1 : he represent again?\n\nspk_0 : He's he's representing the mob.\n\nspk_2 : Right. Okay, it feels like that. I just want to make sure he wasn't back on the union side. Cause is definitely not on the inside, but\n\nspk_0 : the union has taken over the guild. Right? Okay. So garbage guys around town start having problems. A bomb went off near one owner's home. A fire burned down the office and three chuck's of another garbage men started being beaten and shot at jesus christ. Garbage is fucking serious. Business crazy. I\n\nspk_1 : got to get in the garbage\n\nspk_2 : business. I don't want to do anything crazy. Like be a garbage man. I think maybe a cup.\n\nspk_0 : So then front. Oh, mike, freddo didn't like what was happening.\n\nspk_2 : Big mike fredo, our little mike freddo,\n\nspk_0 : big mike fraud. Oh, not little more,\n\nspk_2 : I guess, to be mike greene, mike freddo, green. Anyway, keep going.\n\nspk_0 : Hey, so he quits and he starts his own organization, the kaya haga see. Yeah, I know, I looked it up, there's a big controversy. Some people say it one way, and other people say it another way, so for sure, if they're going to yell up the kaya haga county refuse hollers association that's the name of the one he started, what what is it? The kaya haga county refuse hollers association.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, they're celebrating our pronunciation so much I can't hear\n\nspk_0 : so then, obviously, danny's upset about this because he's franco's created a alternative, repetitive garbage union sort of garbage union wars of the best,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, that's, a tlc show. So,\n\nspk_0 : danny. So danny sends his bomb guy to blow up mike.\n\nspk_2 : Wow, I mean, unbelievable this's a riel,\n\nspk_0 : but the but the bomb guy had never blown up a guy he's, only blowing up cars and building well,\n\nspk_1 : this is\n\nspk_2 : a great opportunity for him to sort of expand his portfolio that's, right? I mean, I know we're not. We're having trouble finding a hero in this story, but I think, it's, maybe the advancement of this bomb guys career. I also do people now,\n\nspk_1 : just up there to the resume, boys. Hey, buzz and boys, it says, here on your resume,\n\nspk_0 : you blow up my frat, okay,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, that was a fun one. Yeah,\n\nspk_1 : mike was sort of my\n\nspk_2 : gateway human. Oh,\n\nspk_0 : sorry, we're talking about big mike front or a little mike, freddo,\n\nspk_2 : big mike little mike franco's names actually green mike, freddo green. You're thinking a danny fredo was actually danny green, fredo, you know, they got cancelled,\n\nspk_1 : I don't know.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, no strong female presence, yeah,\n\nspk_1 : and that diverse enough.\n\nspk_2 : So what are you going to do\n\nspk_0 : it? I get it. So the guy, obviously nervous, he put, he puts the bomb on\n\nspk_1 : him and try this jacket\n\nspk_2 : on. Oh, shit, nothing. What was that allowed?\n\nspk_1 : Fuck, shit, this is a\n\nspk_2 : jacket for you now. Shut up!\n\nspk_1 : So this time\n\nspk_0 : you had you would be nearby and you could hit a remote that's how your that's all these bombs were going off\n\nspk_1 : how are you getting a bomb on\n\nspk_0 : him well then I put a bomb in a car\n\nspk_2 : okay just bomb okay\n\nspk_1 : right can you say you don't know can you wear this jacket when you say bama hume i'm like pickles because he's bob\n\nspk_2 : humans in a bar so he's bombed humans but he's now known\n\nspk_0 : he's only bombed empty oh places this\n\nspk_2 : so it's a murder step for murder step got it\n\nspk_0 : s o he puts a bomb on mike franco's car and then he takes it off because he's freaked out and then he calls mike fredo and tells him what's going on\n\nspk_2 : jesus christ so that mike's like i'm sorry can\n\nspk_1 : you say that one more time you're\n\nspk_2 : breathing really heavy into the phone so I put the bomb in your call but then I took the palm off was gonna kill you man\n\nspk_1 : I just wanted a bigger resume i'm sorry onside for almost what I did so now round the\n\nspk_0 : time cop ed cova sitch who's one of the guys who went down to beginning he just happened to call the bomb guy and started bluffing that they had a bunch of evidence against him for other bombing bomb\n\nspk_2 : guys are weak links yeah that's that's that's the sorrows l\n\nspk_0 : that's our our message\n\nspk_2 : teo that's where you go? Pick the bomb guy.\n\nspk_0 : So the guy just totally caved, and he went in, and he gave a forty page statement on danny and other gangsters around Cleveland he just fucking rolled a little while later, danny called the bomb guy and said he needed him to blow up fredo again. He's, like, we're not done, you didn't finish the job,\n\nspk_1 : and that, again,\n\nspk_0 : this time, for real, for real, do it. Dress rehearsal is over, so the bomb guy told his girlfriend, quote, i'm dead if I don't, and i'm dead, if I do, okay, cool fun! So now. So? So he knows where franco's car is. He already told\n\nspk_2 : fredo the deal, though. So now he's gotta like re bombing after confessing. Yeah. So he's gonna be a tough sell, he calls feels like mike's going to take a day or two off driving.\n\nspk_0 : Well, he calls in a bomb. The bomb guy calls in a bomb threat. He called building nearby he's\n\nspk_2 : gone rogue.\n\nspk_0 : Well, he wanted he wanted a bunch of cops to be around.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, so that he couldn't.\n\nspk_0 : But he didn't do it right. He didn't do. The car wasn't right in front. It's a building nearby. Okay, so he's he's going crossing the street to put the bomb in the car and he blows up.\n\nspk_1 : He just says so he did\n\nspk_2 : blow up, appear a person. Finally\n\nspk_0 : remember it's, a remote who's got the remote. Oh, no, we don't know it. Just so happens. I go though. I happen to be, though, that a guy who gave a forty page statement was crossing the road with the bomb and the bomb blew up\n\nspk_2 : that danny asked him to carry\n\nspk_1 : well. Well, when you start\n\nspk_0 : doing math. Some people thought it was an accident. A lot of people think danny pushed the remote so anyway\n\nspk_2 : I know what I\n\nspk_0 : so all these cops also nearby so the cops all come running frat toes in an office nearby the whole time it's a whole fucking shit show jesus now at the same time shawn er burns starts hitting up danny and introducing him to loan sharking and numbers rackets and he's getting danny involved and one of danny's first assignments was to bomb the house of a numbers runner who was refusing to pay protection. Okay, so danny drove to the house with a homemade explosive jesus and he's a block away and he's driving and he pulls out the igniter but the fuse is burning way faster than he expected\n\nspk_2 : that he lit the fuse before so this is a cartoon bomb he has\n\nspk_1 : I think you I\n\nspk_0 : think you pull off a thing in it and it lights it yes oh he's living\n\nspk_1 : till you get yourself on the ready I mean if you want a firework\n\nspk_2 : you get the ready position if you have a\n\nspk_1 : bomb in your car you're not\n\nspk_2 : like like that fuse all right. How close do we let's figure this out? I like o'clock myself I like a little tic talk to keep me going who needs caffeine? I have a lip balm in the car and i'm two blocks away with traffic let's go\n\nspk_0 : so he he lights it and it's going too fast. So he goes to, he just goes to get rid of it and throw it out the window before he's at the guys.\n\nspk_1 : Does he have multiple personalities? He can't be doing all this he's, good, he's got\n\nspk_0 : it, he throws, it goes to throw it out the passenger window, but he misses.\n\nspk_2 : This is really not going to hit\n\nspk_0 : the door frame and bounces back in,\n\nspk_2 : ok, so right, okay, so this is like boris from bullwinkle, essentially.\n\nspk_0 : So danny opens door, jumps out of the\n\nspk_1 : car, jumps out of the car. Hey, as he made a good decision yet.\n\nspk_0 : And the car explodes. But he just got up and walked away with just a slight injury to his ear. Drum left him hard, hard of hearing in that ear for life. He would later say, quote, luck of the irish.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah. His irish is up for sure. I kicked a lucky that whole thing. You know what? That lip balm in the car and got out, just lost my hearing in my right here, but god's got smiled upon me.\n\nspk_0 : He told the police that someone drove by and threw a bomb in his car.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, not as easy as\n\nspk_2 : it sounds, either the guy somehow got it, let it the right time and threw it out the window, which, believe me, is no no picnic, tell you that, not from experience, but, yeah, I got it right through the window. Shouldn't I had it down?\n\nspk_1 : Around this\n\nspk_0 : time, danny really started to embrace his irish heritage.\n\nspk_2 : His irish is way up. He'd\n\nspk_1 : always been proud\n\nspk_0 : of it, but now he was reading books on\n\nspk_1 : he's, been insane about\n\nspk_0 : it. Yeah, now, he's reading books on Celtic history. Mmm, especially what fuck, I don't know why l see my business, like sixty four, sixty, I took out, took out most of the dates because it was driving it's like seventy it's, like seventy, seventy. The question now. Congratulations as they're given.\n\nspk_2 : We could picture the saturday night fever soundtrack for a lot of this now.\n\nspk_0 : So he was especially into the legend of the ancient celtic warrior college. We're going to be terrible, kill the warriors were known to have mastered the arts of clever speech and war.\n\nspk_2 : I don't believe he's mastered either that's. Why I couldn't get a bomb out of the car,\n\nspk_0 : he thinks, that's him to a tee he's like, yeah, I mastered clever speech in war a long time ago, andi had the same color hair as the warriors, so basically he thought he was Celtic or\n\nspk_2 : no, he is the same color hair, so for sure, what are the odds? You know what I mean? Yeah, he couldn't throw a bomb at an open window that he lit too early. This guy's ready, thank you, it's.

But the judge threw it out, it's\n\nspk_1 : only his third offense. My god, I am sick and tired of good people. Big brought in front of me with these bullshit charges. He's, a baby for god's sake. You don't know, no better. Mama's heart pop data couldn't raise him. Grandpa worked the night shift. Boys guilty of one thing and that's been adorable. Come sit on my\n\nspk_2 : knee while I do this. Danny.\n\nspk_1 : I want them out of\n\nspk_2 : watch. This he's. A good little boy in me. Yeah.\n\nspk_0 : So the judge threw out, and when he did, he said, quote, the evidence indicates that mike freddo is attempting to assassinate danny greene in a struggle for control of the rubbish hauling business.\n\nspk_2 : So it's, like, yeah, your honor, we understand what happened. What do you think about it? Oh, right, that part. I miss being a lawyer.\n\nspk_0 : The name is free, it was news hey was very good with the press. At this point, it was constantly being interviewed by tv and newspapers. Ah, this is a time when a lot of mafia guys would go in front of the press and, like talk, they still sort of dio, yeah, but they used to do it a lot more. Come on, their assassination attempts that were never reported in the news.\n\nspk_1 : What level are you\n\nspk_2 : considered an assassination attempt? I feel like this is a little high for him. I mean, the shit head like, isn't just a murder attempt on him. I mean, yeah, but I mean, like, when we're saying assassin, like, if someone tries to, like, shoot a regular person, you're not like\n\nspk_1 : you tried to assassinate that man we like. That was an attempted murder. Is this dude at assassination\n\nspk_2 : level? Today, we'll be discussing that.\n\nspk_0 : Lookinto word talk. We're going to talk about what words being. It's a fair question. Nancy said that once he was stabbed an inch away from his heart, his daughter said, one time he came home through the backdoor quote, he came crawling up the back. A bomb had gone off, and he crawled over the freeway, which happened to be just behind our house. He was singed, head to toe, his eyebrows and eyelashes were burned off. That was dad. Mom cleaned him up,\n\nspk_1 : mom. Again, first of\n\nspk_2 : all, the bombs. He's, using our for sure cartoons.\n\nspk_1 : Well, since you had had a mom clean it up.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, daddy, i'll get the eyebrows. So\n\nspk_0 : so danny left his wife, nancy, in nineteen seventy four, partly because nancy was worried the girls would get hurt with all the yeah, fascination. Know the freeway crawls. Hey, moved to an apartment in collinwood. He felt very good because the street, a block away, was named\n\nspk_2 : danny. So it's. The little things. When you're losing everything that's,\n\nspk_0 : right? He loved phones and had five installed in his house.\n\nspk_1 : From what? A telethon. What is five lines\n\nspk_2 : going to dio?\n\nspk_0 : They were all green.\n\nspk_1 : Even worse, e, I mean, such a dumb\n\nspk_2 : decision, which one's, which, well, I had to keep the irish pride up. Okay? Which ones? Which number? Though,\n\nspk_0 : he would sit outside in a lawn chair and soak in the sun, he found a barber. He liked nearby and went there, even though the guy was italian. Hey, told the barber quote. I hate those fucking day goes. You're the one I like.\n\nspk_2 : A special kind of friendship. You know that. Barbara was like\n\nspk_0 : danny was the robin hood of collinwood. He was robin column. Would the neighborhood loved him. He paid kids ten bucks to run errands. When a woman's washing machine broke, he bought her a new one. He paid the four year tuition at a girl's school for a local waitress, he by people food if they couldn't afford it, and he'd pick up tabs at restaurants. On easter, he'd give away hams on thanksgiving, he give away turkeys, so everyone just he's the fucking sure, yeah, he's, santa thanksgiving. And there wasn't much trouble in collinwood, because criminals knew danny was around she's this when hell's angels showed up.\n\nspk_2 : Whoa, whoa, whoa, already.\n\nspk_0 : And we're apparently threatening a local guy. Danny went over and knocked on the door when they opened\n\nspk_2 : it of the hells angel home. Hello, hells angels,\n\nspk_0 : whoever's holding wass whomever's home. They're staying out is when they opened it. Danny was standing there with three sticks of dynamite.\n\nspk_2 : Don't make me kill myself on your property. Hello, have a cartoon\n\nspk_0 : gets. He lit the fuse with a cigar.\n\nspk_1 : Like he clearly been watching clint eastwood movie. Yeah, right, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I got an idea.\n\nspk_1 : He just seeing the\n\nspk_2 : good aboutthe lighting dynamite with a cigar\n\nspk_0 : so he likes with a cigar. And then he says to him, if anything's happens to this man, i'll blow you up. I'll blow up your house and i'll blow but he hells angels I confined,\n\nspk_1 : blowing\n\nspk_2 : up it's such an elevated threat. Oh, my god! It's! Like you're like did I thought the worst case scenario was guns it's like, no, i'll put dynamite, anya,\n\nspk_1 : now there\n\nspk_0 : is such a difference between twenty and gun it someone in just standing there with little\n\nspk_1 : hells angels, hell's, angels,\n\nspk_2 : a gun they're like well, fucking get it so the guy's, like i'll blow each one of you up it's like jesus christ, but leave the dude alone, okay, sorry, man. So your eyebrows just the hairless wonder with three let's sticks of dynamite. This\n\nspk_1 : isn't my first time, no shit! Oh, my god,\n\nspk_2 : what is happening? Dynamite co jacks on the porch. He's. Still smoking?\n\nspk_1 : I'm running errands today buys\n\nspk_0 : so then after you said that he pulled the fuse and he threw it away in the the blasting cap went off, and then he stared at them and he walked away, and they're like, you guys, we should go,\n\nspk_2 : we should get out of here. We actually\n\nspk_1 : way going as a five, we're going to dinner. That's two hundred five helps you out, everybody\n\nspk_2 : up in let's find a way to do that right now at somewhere else. You don't like it here. I don't like it here, either. I want you people are fucking crazy. Oh, I mean, he seemed nice. I mean, besides being bald, inflaming, that was fine.\n\nspk_0 : S o danny decided to open an after hours club with\n\nspk_2 : good I was just about to say it's time for him to get in the nightclub business for sure seems like the right era\n\nspk_0 : hey went to shawn er burns who got him seventy thousand dollars great which mostly came from the gambino family in new york city on\n\nspk_2 : the up and up we all know that\n\nspk_0 : and they know it will be good for sure for some reason burns demanded that danny use a specific guy to handle some stuff with the business yeah um and he had the guy korir the money so the guy he's going to get the money from the gambinos and bring it tio to danny okay now the guy was a cocaine dealer it's a bad start so the guy took the money and bought coke with it hoping to sell it and turn into a quick scores\n\nspk_2 : well, normally that works out terrific for all parties involved so\n\nspk_0 : this isn't this plan has never gone\n\nspk_2 : you know the key is you don't do the cocaine which is easy for a coquette is going a bunch of it it is my\n\nspk_1 : business cocotte my\n\nspk_2 : coke and they will\n\nspk_1 : never combine\n\nspk_0 : but what happened was was that the cops have been investigating him for a while and they just happen to raid his apartment right when he had bought all the coat\n\nspk_1 : the worst time possible.\n\nspk_0 : So he threw all the coke out his fourth storey window.\n\nspk_2 : That's.

Two zero.\n\nspk_2 : Hey, math, you're fired, fax, you fired fax.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, sorry. Danny, obviously danny's like this isn't happening, so not good burns puts out a hit on danny for twenty five thousand boy now everyone everyone wants in on it. It's\n\nspk_2 : not good.\n\nspk_0 : No, a group of local burglars made the first attempt,\n\nspk_2 : a group of local burglars. They have. They\n\nspk_1 : have a union,\n\nspk_2 : how you doing? Where the bandit masks?\n\nspk_0 : They put a bomb on danny's car.\n\nspk_2 : We're looking to\n\nspk_0 : expand. Danny was at a gas station when the attendant noticed something hanging under his car.\n\nspk_1 : You got a bomb underneath your car, mister. I'm gonna wash you want. I should do the windows and remove the bomb. The oil looks a little low. You could use more watching fluid, it's, somebody's, trying to take your life. Yeah, b five. Seventy five.\n\nspk_0 : Lieutenant dan takes the bottom off. And then he calls up the policeman and co visage. Now, custovic, fuck that. Now ed it moved a couple blocks away from danny just coincidentally and over a little bit of time they had become sort of like friends like they liked each other it's like a movie they liked each other and respect each other but he still wants to put danny in jail right so danny asked ed to come over to his apartment and he showed him the broken clothes pin which is what I guess the two sides of the clothes pin the way was supposed workers once they touched the bomb was supposed to go off\n\nspk_2 : just certain clothes pins not anyone's any clothes pin no no no\n\nspk_0 : if if the tips of a clothes pin touch babu it's really it's a really hazardous thing but merisi most most people hanging clothes have gotten used to it first i'm hearing of it so close been a battery and a blasting cap and I was like where's where's the explosives and danny said quote it's going back to the son of a bitch that sent it to me\n\nspk_2 : so what you call a cop over mid retaliatory murder yeah he\n\nspk_1 : tried to do that to me\n\nspk_2 : that's why I called you anyway i'll kill him good to see you I\n\nspk_1 : pay a actually not one and why had you come over here? Why don't I buy you? I shouldn't be telling you\n\nspk_2 : any of this.\n\nspk_1 : This seems like an extra unnecessary step. I hold this\n\nspk_2 : battery and clothes pin\n\nspk_0 : so kopassus itch, or whatever the fuck his name is. Sedef burns got blown up. He'd have to testify against danny and danny said, quote. Nobody's going to believe you. Confident gentlemen a few months later a few months later danny was jogging in the exact same area he had been when night mike yoga shot treadmill something he likes working\n\nspk_1 : on jumping jacks yeah other stuff\n\nspk_0 : burpees it's near a beach she liked it there it was nice\n\nspk_1 : but I wouldn't really feel comfortable\n\nspk_2 : walking up last the place where I was assassinated almost ah lot of memories come back here why play fetch with the dogs where I almost got blown up a lot of fun\n\nspk_0 : a sniper was hidden in the bushes and started shooting it danny so\n\nspk_1 : what like at what point you I mean it's like you're the jerk he hates cans what is it with this area what is it I don't think\n\nspk_0 : danny's right as much as he is insanely green just stubborn downwards he figured danny the sniper clearly figured danny would hide or run away because that's what people do in a sniper sure adam what danny pulled his revolver started shooting at the sniper sniper and charging straight at it\n\nspk_1 : that is not that is just so not in the sniper handbook oh nobody last year's go shit like in your scope\n\nspk_2 : here like he is running right towards oh my god I gotta pack up a bunch of shit I gotta break some stuff down get this packed up I get i'll clean that in the car.

And it was a huge explosion. See, four was used. Burns was blown out the roof of the car.\n\nspk_2 : Terrible time to be named burns. What? Godel burns,\n\nspk_0 : a friend of burns, try to drag him away, but realized he was on ly dragging the top half of burns. His legs were fifty feet away. Other parts had rained down around the church a lot. A lot of him was on the chain link fence between the church and chris tickets. It's the cops wouldn't let the people in the church leave until all the pieces of the body were picked up.\n\nspk_2 : We're just looking for five fingers and then we'll open these doors. Gang, we are five digits away from this nightmare being over. I'm so sorry.\n\nspk_1 : You guys keep playing bingo\n\nspk_0 : in there.\n\nspk_2 : Keep playing. Bingo. It's just again, he went everywhere. He really he is confetti, man. Confetti. We're calling it, but we're sweeping up. We've got a little dirt devil were doing the whole visit more but i'm more comfortable with it than you guys are, but we will have him cleaned up in no time.\n\nspk_0 : There's gotta be something. The bible about exploding people? No. Yeah, no one. One of the people in the church was a grammar school friend of danny's. Small town. Sure. Burns had eight hundred forty three dollars on him that was fluttering all around the car. So\n\nspk_2 : the money survived the money's. Fine. The currencies fine, he's on the fence and little pieces. There are fifty is floating in the air. The\n\nspk_0 : irs came and claim the money\n\nspk_2 : they hold on a second here. Okay. What is\n\nspk_1 : that money? We heard there's been an explosion that goes to us,\n\nspk_2 : we're building bridges.\n\nspk_0 : So the cops are looking at other number runners who might be trying to, you know, come in on his business.\n\nspk_2 : Sure, who could do this?\n\nspk_0 : His wife had no idea he hey had had a falling out with danny and gave burns doberman to danny because she knew he loved dogs\n\nspk_2 : like that must have been a weird exchange. He was like,\n\nspk_1 : thank you, that's, everything,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, so said, right, okay, dummy, that linda bye.\n\nspk_0 : Uh, denny figured that was it. Problem solved. But two months later, two months, an explosion ripped through his apartment. Danny and his seventeen year old girlfriend were on the second floor.\n\nspk_2 : Pardon. Sorry, you put a little it's, a little sneaker in there,\n\nspk_0 : his seventeen year old girlfriend\n\nspk_2 : were and he's at this point. Don't tell me, he's in his forties, what? Five?\n\nspk_0 : Okay, he was he was when the when it exploded, he was flung against the refrigerator, which he held onto and wrote down like an elevator is through\n\nspk_2 : of the second. He frayed, bridged. Just like a grain elevator. Just going down.\n\nspk_0 : Both of them are okay, and they got,\n\nspk_2 : well, i've got to be fair. She survived the explosion, but she's not ok, yeah, no, yeah,\n\nspk_0 : they got into his car and just drove off. Sure,\n\nspk_2 : as one's ought to dio, just hurry up.\n\nspk_0 : All he had was a broken rib. Um, when the police came, they found a second, more powerful mom on danny's backdoor that had not gone off,\n\nspk_2 : because there was the guy from the gas station where\n\nspk_1 : I noticed\n\nspk_2 : that right away, I said, he's, your problem, that's. Why your heat's not working? You\n\nspk_1 : know, I got a big bomb, a c four out back, I\n\nspk_2 : removed it, filled the washer fluid for forty five. If\n\nspk_1 : that one had\n\nspk_0 : gone off, it might have wiped out the entire neighborhood. It still did not turn danny's neighbors against him because he was there, robin hood, they rallied around him the day after the bombing, he was back in a vacant lot. Not far away, he set up two trailers, one is a home, the other is in office. He posted a sign future home of the Celtic club. Oh, no, Celtic Celtic Celtic going their way. People want me to say, Celtic or Celtic people get\n\nspk_2 : really. I would be a lot of people that\n\nspk_1 : want. Celtic i'm going to get\n\nspk_0 : yelled that no matter what I\n\nspk_2 : do know. Danny, warrior of the celtics, larry bird, warrior of the celtics.\n\nspk_1 : He flew the\n\nspk_0 : irish flag on a pole, a bunch of journalists and tv news report.\n\nspk_2 : You and him out there\n\nspk_0 : and gathered around danny spoke directly to a camera quote. I have a message for those yellow maggots that includes the pears and the doers. The doers are the people who carried out the bombing. They have to be eliminated because the people who paid them can't afford tto, have them remain alive, okay, and the pears are going to feel great heat from the fbi and local authorities, and let me be clear something else. I didn't run away from the explosion, someone said they saw me running away. I walked away.\n\nspk_2 : Hi, i'm lazy.\n\nspk_0 : The reporter seem said, it seemed like danny had nine lives. Quote. I'm an irish catholic. I believe that the guy upstairs is pulling the strings, and you're not going to go until he says so wasn't my time yet. So was the the catholic god.\n\nspk_2 : No, actually, as he was walking away, there was only one set of\n\nspk_0 : footprints. So after the newscast, danny was approached by john nardi. They've known each other a while. John nardi arnesen, the tying guy, local union official and mafia associate. Okay, nardi was also having trouble with the mafia. Okay, he said to danny, quote, you got a good thing going here, power, but your flank is wide open. Why don't we form a partnership? Your enemies are my enemies, let's, fight them together, so this actually happened? It wasn't just the movie scene, no israel nardi had contacts, there was no irish mob, so danny had to team up with connected a time guy and their tool.\n\nspk_2 : Second italian I like. And if you cut hair, it'll help me out tremendously.\n\nspk_0 : And the two of them went to war. Danny's Celtic club had a few irish guys in it. An ex cop, a jail official, a stage hand, a bar owner, a roofer, and also danny jr. Who was a teenage. Okay, danny gave them all names of famous Celtic warriors and would quiz them on irish history.\n\nspk_2 : Sweet god. Comfortable setting.\n\nspk_0 : He gave them all green business cards and green pens to hand out\n\nspk_1 : three pence. The handout. What what are you doing?\n\nspk_0 : All the people he\n\nspk_1 : hunted for leper con office.\n\nspk_0 : Hey, how you doing? I'm with the new irish mop is a pin.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, great, I don't support crime\n\nspk_0 : need a cart, there's my card, you can see right down the back. Irish mob can't see\n\nspk_2 : anything. The inks green.\n\nspk_1 : Okay, stupid car. Keep what up? Just walking. Keep it up, buddy. What\n\nspk_0 : do you tell\n\nspk_1 : you? Yeah, i'm italian. Yeah, all right, okay,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, here, you want a\n\nspk_1 : sausage, go fuck yourself. What?\n\nspk_0 : Why would you talk to a celtic warrior like that?\n\nspk_1 : What are you talking about? You talk to me, you handed me\n\nspk_2 : a green pen and said it was from the mob.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, irish mob.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, I don't care.\n\nspk_0 : We just started. We gotto goto, that's a trailer, but got a clubhouse.\n\nspk_1 : I'll call you from my trailer. So you have green pens at a clubhouse and you think you're a mob\n\nspk_0 : that's, how it works, you get stationery, end up in a place to hang out well, there's a government outside, we got a flag.\n\nspk_1 : Very sad.\n\nspk_0 : Fuck you were warriors.\n\nspk_1 : I took it, and i've been intimidated by things\n\nspk_2 : that are coming out of a tree house\n\nspk_0 : and listen to become a category. I took the boat, both the written and oral test, and I passed. So you're talking to a fucking warrior, right?\n\nspk_2 : Let me ask you this. Did the oral test involve a penis? Did it fucking irish. Goodbye.\n\nspk_0 : There's. A Celtic penis. So danny is now a legend in Cleveland. Basically,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, good shit, guys.\n\nspk_0 : But people also had this feeling that he was not going to last very long,\n\nspk_2 : really, what was tipping them to that? I\n\nspk_0 : don't know, but that just increased his legend, like they know that he's going up against the mob annie's,\n\nspk_2 : right? No, they're like he's going to die. It will be amazing\n\nspk_0 : a local teenage kid who was a danny green wannabe wrote a poem called the ballad of danny greene fucking irs danny danny would check his car for a bomb before he got in it. Sometimes he'd sit on the roof of the building next door with a high powered rifle rifle, watching the Celtic club. Sure, yeah, hanging out, he had already decided to get in on the mafia dominated vending machine business. It's all such little penny ante bullshit.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, no, the nickel and dime ing adds up. If you have enough, you know\n\nspk_0 : you guys want to get in on the pinball record. First, danny tried making threats, but it didn't work. A mafia lieutenant confronted danny, and then soon after found a bomb in his car. In september, a mob guy was going to meet danny, and he disappeared. He was found beaten to death in a daze inn\n\nspk_2 : who, well, it's, like unfair. I mean six on this and half a dozen on the other. Feds are not comfort\n\nspk_0 : that's, actually, one of their packages, yeah. Then, on may twenty six, nineteen, seventy six, Cleveland mafia godfather john scale ish died without leaving a clear successor. Word was he had tapped kapo, james jack white lick of oli what let's, just calm jack white because,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, because then I get the picture jack white and they they're about licking volleys.\n\nspk_0 : Danny and I, so danny and nardi saw this is a chance to take over Cleveland, right, the old man's dead, sure, but Cleveland was old school mafia terry tow. It got it's, got some skin from vegas and was one of the original six cities taken over by the mob already demanded a piece of the akron rackets. Akron, ohio akron how far away's, akron,\n\nspk_2 : akron, akron, akron, akron it sounds like a robot processing actress.\n\nspk_1 : Where is akron? How far is akram might be to akron\n\nspk_0 : for his akron where's, akron\n\nspk_2 : and you're lebron james. He is from akron. Yes, he also from akron. I can't build a\n\nspk_1 : school in the background.\n\nspk_0 : So the mob guy in charge of ac kern. Lips. Most cherry\n\nspk_2 : lips. Most seri yeah, big lips. I know. Are you doing? Let's, do this.\n\nspk_0 : I did not like the demands, and the two men screamed at each other. And then lips planned afterwards to take out danny and marty. I'm going to kiss him to death. The mob was furious that danny was even a problem. One was heard on fbi tape. Quote, that cocksucker, that fucking irishman, how the hell did this guy ever come into the picture anyway? It's. A great tape. Yep. In july nineteen, seventy six, eugene the animal quiz, salo. Who led a group of enforcers who are known as the young turks was hit by a bomb on his porch that was hidden in a flowerpot the animal's stomach and intestines were shredded by nails that have been put in the bomb he lived but he went he went to florida\n\nspk_2 : well, teo rehabilitated facility where he could roam with the other animals and frolic in the yard. He's happy?\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, a couple of guys from the Celtic club were stopped by police. They had a pistol, a shotgun and maps with circles on it around the other three young turks homes.\n\nspk_1 : And what do you guys circle\n\nspk_2 : in here? There's? A lot of circles on these maps. Yeah. Uh, that's where share lives really? Well, alrighty. As you were, gentlemen, enjoy the share tour\n\nspk_0 : lips. Got a phone call at home. Quote leo, you're dead? His girlfriend was worried, but lip said if someone was going to kill him they would never call first.\n\nspk_2 : I think lips is mistaken. He disappeared two weeks later. It's too obvious.\n\nspk_1 : I told you, lips\n\nspk_0 : where was getting around the country? The twenty for coulson know, stir of families we're not happening. This was a major embarrassment. And now danny killed a made guy. Killing burns is one thing, but he wasn't made because he was jewish. Danny didn't understand how big the mob was and how Cleveland was tied into other cities. Now the u s mob had no choice but to kill danny. They called in a hitman from california ray fair ito what's up that's, right, let's shred, um he was offered a twenty five percent of gambling profits and young stone youngstown that was. Come on now, it's, just fucking funny and warren to kill both danny and nardi. Ray brought in a second guy to do the legwork, danny\n\nspk_2 : up on legs,\n\nspk_0 : danny in artie's daily activities were very purposefully erratic, which made finding them and killing them hard. But everyone in town wanted kill Denver leonardo. Just leave. So before ray was done, negotiating what danny and them know, they think they're taking over,\n\nspk_2 : but they're going to get I mean, everybody's trying to kill them. They\n\nspk_0 : think they're taking over that's, delusional. Okay. Before ray was done, negotiating the deal, the hit deal. Three other mob guys tried to kill nardi as he unlocked his car at the brotherhood club. They shot at him with a sniper rifle from a railroad bridge. They missed, and he drove away. Okay? A few days later,\n\nspk_2 : I like to run at the assassins, let the old danny beach approach.\n\nspk_0 : A few days later, someone job by tardis. He walked on a sidewalk and shot at him with shaka reporters. Asked if the new godfather was trying to kill him and nardi said he was friends with everybody,\n\nspk_1 : i'm friends with all these guys, yeah, he's, my body's, he's, just goofing. Two weeks\n\nspk_0 : later, danny put a bomb and another mob guy's car, but he parked, but he parked his car in his neighbor's driveway, the mob guy. Okay, so when the neighbor humped in the mob, guys\n\nspk_2 : are, you\n\nspk_1 : know, just to move it. Yeah, god\n\nspk_0 : first gotta die first civilian to die so the bombings weren't just happening with danny nardi and the mob. The mob is having an internal war to take over control of Cleveland. There were so many bombs going off thirty seven jesus that the Cleveland Cleveland press reporter called it bomb city, yusa cool, the tripled, their manpower in the area.\n\nspk_2 : We're doing three guys.\n\nspk_0 : On april fifth, nineteen, seventy seven, a huge bomb went off in collinwood. It was a mafia guys car. But the body inside, it was not. The mafia guy turned out to be a hells angel who blew himself up on trying to put the bomb in the car. He had been paid by danny. This really pissed off the mob because they had a contract to work with the hell's angels and now the hell's angels were frozen out of mob contracts for two years.\n\nspk_1 : I mean, I can't believe our corporate\n\nspk_2 : it is. It is the vc. They deal with this teo.\n\nspk_0 : So mafia Cleveland mafia later jack white needed more men the previous leader had not made anyone in ages and he asked the godfather any work for permission after hearing about danny the godfather gave him permission to make ten new soldiers in Cleveland make you could make ten new guys you could make larry knees jackson that's it civilian mob sorry the Cleveland mob then worked an fbi secretary to get a list of informants so this is the only time this has ever happened I believe but basically this woman her husband are boyfriend worked with someone at a car lot who knew a mob guy and they started working because there was some sort of lawsuit against her and our husband and the mob zack we could make that go away if you just get us a list of mob informants okay so she fucking went into the fbi office and snuck into the fucking onda wrote down the names okay of all the guys do any green was at the top of the list sure okay around this time danny and nardi decide to buy a struggling texas cattle ranch\n\nspk_2 : yeah no it's I was going to say whether they're going to get involved in livestock how soon till then we all saw it coming\n\nspk_0 : the plan was to sell meat through a discount purchasing program\n\nspk_2 : obviously remembers yeah no for sure know we're going to make okay burgers it all makes sense. The\n\nspk_0 : ranch owner had to sell because he had been acquitted of selling explosives to cuba, but the case to put him in debt.\n\nspk_2 : Sorry, so he can't keep his cattle because of explosives. And danny, who lives in explosives, is sinking, is getting him out of dead. Okay,\n\nspk_0 : danny and artie thought this was their ticket out. Take it out. What about the business? They're going to go be a cattleman in context. They're ranchers. Danny bought western wear, including green cowboy boots,\n\nspk_1 : so he's, just like\n\nspk_0 : and a green cowboy hat. Yeah. So the plan was through nardi. The gambino family would back it, and danny would run it. They went to\n\nspk_2 : moreland road and roll, and\n\nspk_0 : so they drove teo the Cleveland airport, and they got on playing went to new york and the hit man a different one than ray. I found out that and watch them parked the car and then put a bomb in their car and then waited for them to come back from new york, and they were in a hotel and they saw danny and already return, and they sat in hotel and they press the remote button, but they were too far away\n\nspk_1 : there. Out of the what? How do you not know the range? They're not walkie talkies and your eight? And then as\n\nspk_0 : the car back down drove away, they're like running down the stairs.\n\nspk_2 : Get back in rage, get begging rage than out on\n\nspk_0 : the street like chasing him trying to present\n\nspk_1 : went out of\n\nspk_0 : it didn't work on may seventeen nineteen, seventy seven marty's car was parked behind the teamsters office. He parked it in a different place every day, but the hitman had found it as the unlocked his car. The car next to his exploded and blew his legs off. Jesus people ran out to help, they're over nardi, and he said, quote, it didn't hurt, and then he died. What\n\nspk_1 : were his last words? I'm fine, it is\n\nspk_2 : great toe, have crazy last words may as well. It\n\nspk_1 : didn't hurt, I could just live view that they were never attached. Wait, what? I never had legs, they were faked the whole time. What my nickname is no legs, nardi.\n\nspk_0 : After danny held interviews with tv and newspaper reporters, he told one, quote, I have no ax to grind, but if somebody wants to come after me, i'm over here by the Celtic love,\n\nspk_1 : they're coming after\n\nspk_0 : you, it's not hard to find may so the mob was livid that he was being so brazen. Jesus, all the while, the hit man and his sidekick were driving around looking for danny, but he was extremely elusive. Danny sent where to jack white, that he want a cease fire on the mob, boss said danny would have to kill his lieutenant, who had killed lips. Okay, danny wouldn't do it then the explosion expert who made the bomb that killed already vanished. That's, the mob cleaning up.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, I thought you meant no spirit took him it's. What? It sounded like\n\nspk_0 : no. In september nineteen, seventy seven, a mob wire guy got into danny's home and his hangouts and tapped all of his phones.\n\nspk_2 : All five of the greenies. Hard to know. What's going on in here. All the wires are green.\n\nspk_0 : Dani's girlfriend called in an appointment for danny to get it to fixed at the dentist\n\nspk_2 : so scandalous you're right it's a mola it's a back left molar\n\nspk_0 : they finally knew where he was gonna be and exactly what time so they hit menace psychic drove to the dentist and two two cars one was a bomb car danny parked crab his leather gym bag inside was a semiotics pistol a clip of bullets a list of car license plate numbers of mafia enemies a dental bank a box of green ink pens\n\nspk_2 : sure you don't know for sure what you take to the dentist\n\nspk_0 : and a mother of perpetual help holy card\n\nspk_2 : yet for sure get the usual stuff you take teo a dental appointment\n\nspk_0 : as usual danny had parked between two cars so no car could pull out and pull in right ok so as soon as he left the car next is pulled out and they pulled the bomb current\n\nspk_2 : okay, yeah, that is maybe a flaw in the plan well these will never leave but\n\nspk_1 : the thing\n\nspk_0 : is I would walk out and I would look at that car wasn't part next time\n\nspk_2 : yeah yeah there's a lot of problems i'd be like I need more cars i'm going to ride a bike\n\nspk_0 : thank you so as he was getting in his car ah, they blew up the car next to his blew up. The dentist was like down his left arm was blown eight feet away, his closer ripped off, his naked body was sucked under the car. His own car by the force of the blast. Danny greene was forty three. It was the thirty eighth bombing in Cleveland in a year. Holy shit. I took out all the parts about paces ever.\n\nspk_2 : The bomb took out other\n\nspk_0 : parts. Nancy was told by her boss at work, her daughter's learned through the media. A strike force was put together with members of the fbi Cleveland police and justice department. A cop's daughter have to be in the parking lot at the time. She also happened to be a sketch artist. Oh,\n\nspk_2 : no, but here they are.\n\nspk_0 : So when the bomb went off and she saw guy calmly driving away she's like that's where so she sketched the guy's face down and she showed the law enforcement and they're like that's ray wow, and they went arrested ray. In the vice of the car was the registration of the the car that blew up danny. So the way they connected the two cars was because of that, the little sticker you put on your license plate, huh? So it has a number on it, a sequential numbers. So they had registered the cars back to back, so they were in sequential numbers so they could tie them together. Oh,\n\nspk_2 : wow, well, we didn't know about that that's, right? Where the d m v. We're also not fucking around. Yeah, Denver Post saturdays on cbs. We have a d m v informant.\n\nspk_1 : Well, not the Denver fuck wit.\n\nspk_2 : B thirty eight.\n\nspk_1 : You want some? You want a fucking license? I didn't think so. All right, rookie. You parked up till you've got a con front of your car behind\n\nspk_2 : you, parallel which where the wheels turn and\n\nspk_1 : now go away. Close one eye. Look\n\nspk_0 : at the screen, you son of a bitch!\n\nspk_2 : Read the third line,\n\nspk_0 : what's that say. You wear glasses.\n\nspk_2 : Class d it's. Gonna be a wild day.\n\nspk_0 : No, we don't do driver's tests were a fucking satellite. D m v. Get the fuck\n\nspk_2 : out of here! Good lawyer! We've got the fbi and the d m v involved in this one. C a a d m v goes all the way to the top, what's\n\nspk_1 : that the fbi one though, some back cause I got conned\n\nspk_0 : knowledge. I'm from the d m v. We're\n\nspk_2 : kicking the fbi out of here. This is d m v territory.\n\nspk_1 : Once the\n\nspk_0 : investigators were able to connect the two cars, the mob put out a hit on ray ray, then flipped. He also fled because the Cleveland mob was incredibly cheap. So the whole time he was looking for danny, they refused to pay for his expenses, for they kept saying, he kept giving them expense receipts, and they'd be like, yeah, we'll get you that money.\n\nspk_2 : Oh, yeah, for sure, yeah, no, we run a real tight ship in the account, excited this. Yeah, you know how the mob is were meticulous with numbers because of, you know, right off.\n\nspk_0 : He had also raid, also been promised a brand new car for killing danny. But afterwards, they told him to just keep the getaway car, which was a used ohio state patrol car.\n\nspk_2 : A new to you, no, teo.\n\nspk_0 : So he was furious, and he flipped after he flipped jimmy the weasel friday on the\n\nspk_2 : easel, flipped. Who could see that coming?\n\nspk_0 : That was apparently a big flip when once the weasel flipped,\n\nspk_1 : yeah, right, i'll flip toe. Holy shit, you guys, we should have known his name was a fucking weasel.\n\nspk_2 : When have you ever heard about not being able to trust a weasel?\n\nspk_0 : The only two guys, only two guys were convicted for danny's murder, allie, sister, nino, ronald, the crab sarabia.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, trying to get away on all fours, grab him, just come from. This is ridiculous.\n\nspk_1 : I'm the crab. You're not going to get the crowd, get your fucking hands off our pay. All my legs, he's coming at you, sideways, boys. Yeah, didn't see that coming. Did you? Hi, blended with this rock. Don't I\n\nspk_2 : know you could see me pretty clearly.\n\nspk_0 : Um, but afterwards, others went down on rico, charge, just more flipped. The Cleveland mob was done in five years. This eventually spread out across the nation as guys kept flipping on each other on enter a mob, boss flipped mohr and more flipped. Two hundred fifty, people were put into witness protection.\n\nspk_2 : They're like recognizing each other. Oh, shit, no, my name's. Stand now! I'm a d m v register. Holy shit, look atyou.\n\nspk_0 : The entire la cosa nostra was toast, and it all started with danny greene's. War and killing. Now and cup capacity capacity we did. We came close. No, became the future police chief of flavor, for sure, and he said, quote, if we could have arrested every fbi informant in Cleveland, there would have been no more crime in Cleveland. Because everybody was an fbi informant.\n\nspk_2 : Just a flip fast\n\nspk_0 : that's. The danny greene story.\n\nspk_2 : Baby greening. He's. A real nature versus nurture, huh?\n\nspk_0 : He was. Chill, but he's like, is he, like, consider like a hero here? What is he, he's, not it's society, because they made a movie about this cop killing the arson, but it wasn't a comedy, right like this is a fucking comedy, like I don't know who writes that movie and doesn't make it a comedy, but you blew it because it's a like, put that in the coen brothers hands,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, truly an amazing film, that's, very true,\n\nspk_0 : but it's, not it's, not a scary thing. It's.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, there's, a little it's, just idiots. Too much tomfoolery going on.\n\nspk_1 : Well, the mob\n\nspk_0 : is usually really stupid. I mean, they're\n\nspk_1 : but a body, like, if thirty eight\n\nspk_2 : bombs go off in a year like you should be scared. But then you also have, like so many miss bombings. Yeah, it's like miss connections. You driving a gray cadillac, be trying to end it. I went to the hotel, the relax and watch you as I was spying, you were out of range in a couple of ways. What a town! Thank\n\nspk_1 : you guys so much for coming out. We really appreciate it. God! Spade god, baby.

So\n\nspk_1 : right. Ok. And well, as we all know from the history of minnesota that happened. Great scott is minnesota in exchange for well, this guy's, just straight up came here. That\n\nspk_2 : also is very common for really rich lords to pay for people to go to other countries, you know, pay instead of like, no, get the fuck off my land.

Soon hey, said he want to resettle tenants from his overcrowded skosh estates to miss the idea of blue colonel loomis's my way.

You've got four letters from people do what you like in our fair town.\n\nspk_2 : The northern pacific railroad at the time wanted to expand westward, but it was difficult and expensive. Company needed to raise a lot of money perfect time. So the idea of a wealthy scottish guy by huge parts of land from the company was very, very exciting to the top brass. The liver's saw him as gordon is an answer to the railroad's problems. He offered to take gordon gordon in an excursion. Two different plan sites, all expenses paid. Just stay. We'll expose if you pick up the top of his will. Looking for a queen? His lordship announced he was ready to take out lands and that this was acceptable. Unfortunately, there were no rail runs to take him across the state. Sure. So they took together a big wagon train situation, a wagon train, that's, what it was called before. Trains wagon train, because that's just gonna roll out one wagon, but your wagons,\n\nspk_1 : bunch of wagons. Wagon train is connected to each other.\n\nspk_2 : It's called the wagon train. Sir, are you about eighteen hundred terms very common at the time?\n\nspk_1 : You know, we both do a lot\n\nspk_2 : of research for this. Turn off course horses. Ok, thing to say. Course I was. They were now. No. Even worse, trip. It's. A huge story this way.\n\nspk_1 : So just how we normally record it?\n\nspk_2 : S so he's ready to go big on his lands. Colonel loomis rose to the occasion. He organized a decadent, all expense paid expedition through minnesota and the dakotas. Quote, like the excursion that a polydoras planned for cleopatra on one journey, that traveling with gordon gordon were state officials and officers of the railway. Gordon gordon asked that they simply referred to him as gordon, my lord\n\nspk_1 : i'm gonna need to stop for a dupe in trance. Just get sparkles are enormous. With oh! Go! I'm fucking going. As calm as\n\nspk_2 : a common back then, the hardest thing would have been. There was no one to turn to no fucking,\n\nspk_1 : yeah, there was no one around. You're all. I just have, like a wilson, that he would just go home to be like, fucking crazy. Nashville my lord. And\n\nspk_2 : so they that's what they did. They go, my lord. The\n\nspk_1 : land you've requested, my lord.\n\nspk_2 : No, I was about twenty guys who worked on the journey. They took thirty or forty horses. Gordon gordon. Of course, I, of course. Gordon gordon was keeping a personal secretary as well as a valet who shaved him and wrote his letters\n\nspk_1 : at different times in the head. And get down there going. Yeah. There. So enormous that calls i'm growing a herculean. I'm like pinocchio when a scrotum. Get in. Disney isn't it? Was a lawsuit in a good way?\n\nspk_2 : Big fans is pinocchio guy. They're not really fond of the picture. You paint it with giant testicles. Swell. When you\n\nspk_1 : find a man a good way, you have to read another fifty called. Like pornography. Porno video. Yeah.\n\nspk_2 : So, uh, valet would steal gordon gordon letters with wax that had the gordon coat of arms on it. Sure, yes, the historic banner of the thorns of scotland also fluttered behind one of the wagons.\n\nspk_1 : Sure, that's, right, and just the flag with a pile of bullshit. No, really, really it's a real race, right? Because you can't make a call to find out.\n\nspk_2 : It's got the letter to old tents, were set up for him each night for his exclusive use. So he's got to ten shirt. Yeah, one for maybes. They gave him silver and china to eat off of good. Yeah, fruit was brought in from mexico. Kenny front. His table was like montezuma's. They also had, quote, fourteen changes of costume.\n\nspk_1 : What, like blaming god? What is it, johnny? You\n\nspk_2 : look good, man. You're too. Yeah, fucking sweet new. So cat crotchless, obviously fly. One. Why was packed with guns and ammunition for hunting. Another was packed with equipment, hostages, just fisher. And then this constant changes after dinner after before. After the appetizer change, excuse me, i'm going to slip into something a little more comfortable. Governments there surveyor would gallop ahead of the group and pick out square mileage. That suited lord gordon gordon needs she's\n\nspk_1 : like a real housewife. This's, real housewives go on vacation. I know. They're\n\nspk_2 : good people. They don't want that\n\nspk_1 : shit. I just think, it's, a reference that works, and, you know, some mystic room. We'll talk. So\n\nspk_2 : gordon gordon, nicknamed the government surveyor, galloped ahead. The land taster.\n\nspk_1 : He allowed to push back on his name. You're not really what i'm doing now. You're always thinking, forget blankets, that's, the land looking, you know.\n\nspk_2 : Lord corp for big land, where he plans to build a future town. Yeah, phew, yes, school's\n\nspk_1 : towns. Yeah, I mean, who knows? Laboratories, six flags musician is all in imagination land, and then\n\nspk_2 : they were standing sold on a man. So true here, that was easy, a big, vast areas of land across the state. He'd select locations and name several cities, saying they would need to build churches and schools before the colonists arrived, right, yeah, all right. When he was a local, lakey borrowed, quote. A little change from colonel loomis for expenses.\n\nspk_1 : Well, no bloody believe this. But my current government today. Ta ta! And anyway, no. Hard. But I could use a little walking and a book. I'm good for it looking.\n\nspk_2 : Blue. Hey! After three months, he was done. He has seen enough again, lord gordon gordon explained. He now had to go to new york to put together the money for this massive purchase.\n\nspk_1 : Gordon gordon going to new york, new york that's. Where brought away, isn't\n\nspk_2 : it? So the wagon train returned Minneapolis the total bill. The trip came to over forty five thousand dollars. That's. So, good money.\n\nspk_1 : Well, look, he's got a second tent. I mean, he's got a fuck you tent he's got fuck you tense. Got ten for\n\nspk_2 : his balls in the tent for him.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, I sleep in the tiny one.\n\nspk_2 : Loomis and it was well worth it. He beamed as he told the railroad director's clothes. He is the richest landlord in europe. He will invest five million with us\n\nspk_1 : a real neville chamberlain coming back. Right. War is. Let's, just say I sold it. I sold myself. Ever heard of lord gordon gordon\n\nspk_2 : in january two seventy two, gordon gordon left minnesota, taking his forty thousand dollars out of the bank. Weird\n\nspk_1 : weird moves a little right?\n\nspk_2 : No. It's. Fine. Okay, he's going to get more money she's gonna take out\n\nspk_1 : so it's like blues brothers singing like a scythe dashboard\n\nspk_2 : payday. You get a job like if you have money in the man and you and you go and get a job. Yeah. Then you take all your money,\n\nspk_1 : that's where you lose me a little that's just what? I'm sort of like not\n\nspk_2 : you. Because if he's\n\nspk_1 : coming back yeah, infrastructure bill,\n\nspk_2 : you get images that schools, you bring the money back, right? Okay, but if you leave it in the bank\n\nspk_1 : yeah it's there. I guess it's easier is your point. No, it's got\n\nspk_2 : money has to go with you,\n\nspk_1 : does it? Because I feel like banks. You're good at not making that thing?\n\nspk_2 : No thanks, just there for if you're around. Like you're near it's you, me, near your money. But then, if you go somewhere else, you take your money. And then your money is near you. There,\n\nspk_1 : that's. The definition of wells fargo does it? I think. Well,\n\nspk_2 : it's far takes. Your money goes. You didn't have money.\n\nspk_1 : What right, one commercials now is about, like a train heist back in the day. Imagine that things used to be it's like, yeah, well, sparky, we're fucking familiar with. The best\n\nspk_2 : was used to people's houses recently. And they're like because it was a glitch. Okay. Wait, keep doing this. And no one punishes us, so we can do it. They're coming. It's, just so long she is. Okay, so it takes us forty thousand. They have a good bye banquet before he last year. Yeah, then he was gone. He went to new york with a letter of introduction from colonel loomis to the big man about town, horace greenlee.\n\nspk_1 : Wait now, so loomis probably would have literally would have actually written him a letter, right, right, right. And then I\n\nspk_2 : wrote him a letter for sure,\n\nspk_1 : right, that was can't been unbelievable, and we came in tenth grade score he's, and i'm imagining a lot of\n\nspk_2 : letters from england were really, too. Remember using that grant used to stop s o, the eerie railroad operated in the north east of the united states. It originally connected in new york city with lake erie, which air who wouldn't want that? It was built with public funds, raised by taxes and contracted on land don't needed by public officials and private developers. So it's a public deal. The tests write. Checks is by something that's owned by the public. Everyone's. Happy first, stupid. We should have again to businesses by the elevating fifties, it had been mismanaged, it was in a lot of debt. A rich banker, daniel drew, loaned to million to the railroad and then took control of it. He manipulated shares on the stock exchange and made more money. Then cornelius vanderbilt targeted the railroad for takeover, and in eighteen, sixty six silently, bottom tons of stocks. Now he had control. So drew put a couple of guys on the board, and they trying to wrestle back control from vanderbilt. They did this by issuing illegitimate star, so they just made think, starches\n\nspk_1 : giving thanks time.\n\nspk_2 : So then the more stock was being made. Vanderbilt kept buying it, even though whether riel, they're just fucking\n\nspk_1 : just nothing alive, nothing.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, ok, one of those guys was\n\nspk_1 : the majority shareholder. Nothing. One of\n\nspk_2 : them. One of the guys on the board behind this was jay gould. Golden venable started going toto for controlled the railroad. They went up to the state government and albany and tossed in sand amounts of money at the legislature over a vote that would legalize the fraudulent issue. Stock.\n\nspk_1 : Hey! Lobbying. Yeah,\n\nspk_2 : america's. Like little going up, going, here's money in the illegal thing. I did be legal.\n\nspk_1 : Yes, because of the money. I like money, way. Want to use it for our own stuff. We're not supposed to. This is a lot of money, so we're gonna take it and do stuff for our people. America thanks you.\n\nspk_2 : Cool personally appeared with a bag of five hundred thousand dollars in cash and handed it out to legislators.\n\nspk_1 : Wait, take a guy taking a\n\nspk_2 : bangle. Boys, let's, get their boat going. Come on! Hey, brother, up there, very well would do the same thing. They just went up tons of fucking cash, that ghoulish you.\n\nspk_1 : I wish it was. Now, just see the exchange, you know, then you can use the news, something tio like five under rule and just, yeah, be mortified, just being good, so we could drug use or wiggle.\n\nspk_2 : So vanderbilt ended up so it's past the let's, legalize, let's, legalize issuance of fraudulent star there. Like that sounds good on\n\nspk_1 : over, say, a lot of money. But general ended up\n\nspk_2 : losing seven million dollars, okay, but then he soon gold on gold gave him the money back, but sentiment was out and give up control of the erie railroad. Okay, so gould is dirty and bad and he's, also part of the tammany hall new york situation, she's in pieces, and some of it. Sure so. Now eighteen, seventy cool betrays daniel drew who's, the first guy to go over the rail route, right? By issuing a fraudulent star. Okay. And it worked. And, uh, and this time, drew lost one point. Five billion.\n\nspk_1 : Why? It was really be treating monopoly of the fake stuff. So thes, what do you mean? There's? Two hundred percent.\n\nspk_2 : So the fight's over the roundabout are now known as the eerie war. And this is right with the lord gordon gordon. Camden town. Yeah, it's going to be\n\nspk_1 : right on time. That's. Where? Tio boys. I'm rooting for him. Look,\n\nspk_2 : lord guarded or rented a quote, significant department of sweets on the drawing room floor of the metropolitan hotel.\n\nspk_1 : I kind of missed a little.\n\nspk_2 : So he's got things you'd actually letter to. Horace greeley, we meet. Came bites are screwing me over for breakfast, and horace greeley, he's a politician. You get famous. I don't wipe the whatever later, but\n\nspk_1 : I think I know i'm familiar with his facial hair if\n\nspk_2 : he wasn't. So when greenlee gives their gordon, gordon has opened maps and charts on the table like he's been working.\n\nspk_1 : Get in the middle of my busy season. I'm just trying to figure out a way to conquer plenty of options for me. What does your being that's? Only on your neck.\n\nspk_2 : So so the letters, obviously, big deal. She miss changes. How they did things, my friend so grandly thinks, he's. Great, right? I think, really serious business\n\nspk_1 : for basically, yes, he's like, and used a lighter. You're awesome, okay, great let's, hang out. Yeah, what do you want to talk to me about? I could've gone either way.\n\nspk_2 : Essar's greenlee is the founder and editor of the new york tribune, which had the largest sorghum circulation of the country. He's, also a politician, and would run for president of the same year. So he's, like the fucking man in new york, right on eso. Sometime during this breakfast, lord gordon suddenly state\n\nspk_1 : court. Damn respect for a man. Suddenly\n\nspk_2 : stated that he was the owner of sixty thousand shares of the eerie rail. Also, I am sixty thousand years.\n\nspk_1 : Is that clearly known, like what's going on with that railroad? At this point, i've been like a fairly public battle. Everybody knows. So what? So he's, just how far is thinking of buying this well by the pound?\n\nspk_2 : He also said he was overseeing tons of shares for english friends, is insinuating that he has more shares than anyone else has control of the cure here. Ella, right, but can't you verify that? Can you? Because so many fucked up shares of initials, somebody bullets frighten, ok, so he said he would control the next election of railroad direction directors, and horace love is\n\nspk_1 : looking. Important. That's. Five different. I'm going to be looking at oh, god!\n\nspk_2 : And that doris. This song sucks, man. No. No. No, is that every parent your summers?\n\nspk_1 : Please sing it. Houston. This works. Vince shattered. You're cool, kid. I do have a man.\n\nspk_2 : I'm a clever little daddy. So grand a loves this idea of a new guy coming in a legitimate yeah, this has been coming in, taking over this fucked up railroad. And do you\n\nspk_1 : know they're gonna be so tired of winning\n\nspk_2 : that? He was not referring. I even started referring to as the garden reform movement. A reasonable man was taking over the scandal plagued railroad, horse said. If he could also tell the editor of the new york times and vp of the pennsylvania railroad, colonel scott would be great and his lordship said, jacko, tell us absolutely game changing lives to this shit it's, a ship of the lanterns, it's, the word start spreading pretty quickly over among railroad magnets on everyone is freaking out. Word spread quick that he had been in the states a while already purchased a bunch of land up in minnesota. So for us and the vp of the pennsylvania railroad, they come over the hotel. They rush over quickly, sure, and as powerful as these men, where lord gordon gordon made them wait, he said,\n\nspk_1 : our move, our\n\nspk_2 : there isn't any rich guy with big waves. You\n\nspk_1 : know, the valley comes that's like, i'm sorry,\n\nspk_2 : he's, really looking at the map, sir,\n\nspk_1 : who knows? Maybe two. You know, he's, finding topography for. He wanted me to mention that a few times. No. Hey sent a message\n\nspk_2 : that he would, quote, give them an audience. Shortly as susie had completed his toilet,\n\nspk_1 : is he? Thank you. Three. Taking a shit. Wait, is that normal to start like that way? I'm\n\nspk_2 : assuming toilet is, I mean, way like another center right now, you're going, why don't you tell me that? But I think back then it was just like you need to get myself presentable. I prefer to think that he was taking a dump. So they waited for an hour being honest, so they're finally a lot, then quickly got down to business. Lord gordon gordon talked extensively about what he was there for. He is, I discussed the embarrassment of the railway, lord, gordon said. He has a lots of money, and that he wanted to put a lot of it into the u s. He had bought a lot of land up in minnesota. I was buying more property near new york, where he was going to build a big house and have parties for fancy people like earls and dukes, another oppress,\n\nspk_1 : you know, the barrels, do\n\nspk_2 : csi duchesses more bullshit. March second, an hour after midnight, jaeckel was the local by messenger, a telegram arrived from current. Scott. He was told to come to a conference immediately in the morning at the metropolitan cool, walked into the hotel room and asked the lord gordon gordon what his interest wass in the eerie railroad, his lordship said, I owe thirty minute my own thirty million of the stock, and my friend has twenty million million million, so they're really helping he's got\n\nspk_1 : a lot. Fuck you, you what next, stratosphere, like, impossible, right, okay, saying I control it, right, and a\n\nspk_2 : change in management could no longer be delayed, but luckily, he wanted jaeckel to stay in charge and bring in a new board that he and horace would pick and cool would approvals. Okay, so lord gordon then went on to tell his life story to cool, no that's, the lengthy born into a powerful family. Okay, this version. Entered parliament at the age of twenty two. He was the youngest member of the house of lords. Thank you, junior. The queen trusted him with delicate missions because he desired. Don't be specific of eight eyes very discreet, such as he negotiated with the pressure of government. I never tell anybody what I did. Exact time, deception\n\nspk_1 : with the pressure. But there was no collusion. Anyone seen this pollution? They colluded with russia. Why would I believe that time, didn't I? So at\n\nspk_2 : this point, cool is very anxious to secure the cooperation of lord gordon gordon and the running of the company course, greenlee arrived. Lord gordon then looked at chorus and said he did not trust jay gould. Okay, have you guys been talking for one? Yes, sure, he said, things that lord gordon wanted to hear, but he'd have to give something besides just his word, if he was gonna let gold remains president.\n\nspk_1 : Absolutely. Well, the truth is, dave, you can'tjust trust someone in face value that's, forty dollars, in the bank before you know it. Three letters, people. Everton, vaguely.\n\nspk_2 : Cool said he would hand over his rex and resignation, giving up his power to show him he was. He was working with his lordship, wow, I mean, then his lordship khun reappoint him as president, so it's like a trust exercise where you go, teo, I will resign, and then you make me the\n\nspk_1 : guy. Yeah, sure resigned that's, how\n\nspk_2 : I am gordon, if guards in a cool, did not resign, quote, I could not, under any circumstances, give my support, right? So\n\nspk_1 : right, well, uh, how does a con man play this, exactly? My guess, his cool doesn't love it,\n\nspk_2 : but no gold said they should buy stock in the company together. His lordship declined, saying he didn't want his integrity and finances challenged at the same time. You need to go to the restaurant toilet.\n\nspk_1 : No, don't meet toilet.\n\nspk_2 : Golden said he would quote carry the stock for both you and myself so carry this document he would agree to sell it at a predetermined press for a certain period of time okay so when you do that you are taking out all the obligations\n\nspk_1 : that you love that sounds a little precarious knowing what we know\n\nspk_2 : gold gave him twenty thousand shares at thirty five dollars a share for six months sir gordon said he had already laid out a lot of cash dealing with investigations going get bills pass in albany litigations and he paid for it all himself\n\nspk_1 : sure yeah I which cost a lot of\n\nspk_2 : other people well they said he said they were legitimate expenses that should go against this new organization they're putting together right no cool said that's not unreasonable parts how much over million it turns out i'm sure you know and again I mean look you\n\nspk_1 : have to bring a black eggs to make the world's biggest not let's go\n\nspk_2 : cool quote I agreed to repost with them securities and money to the extent of about one half of his expenses or five hundred thousand dollars this is just for holding once cooled carried out his part of the agreement he would get it all back so it's basically a sign of trust sign give you guys sure you like you want to trust you use to you here is half million\n\nspk_1 : die on then you go ok thank you that's. Good. Now now give it back to shoot. I'll get back to you. Now. Look that limbo is driving. No, you knew. It's! Yeah,\n\nspk_2 : I see you. You're minutes on your bill. Okay, so then the game. Gordon. A bunch of stock in different companies on one hundred sixty thousand dollars. Cash together the total half dollars school. Guard, guard, you're gordon gordon. Gordon gordon then looked in cool and said that there was a problem with the math. Okay. Gordon, you've overpaid, let's, wait, I didn't think there was a problem with the man, but he didn't want to make a big deal about.\n\nspk_1 : This is so applicable. So sorry, malaysia.\n\nspk_2 : So give lord gordon burned another forty thousand dollars. Too weird. It was just usto. Give him anything he wants. Want a lord to make me feel weird places? Testicles, china. I just want to be out of the room. Me\n\nspk_1 : still here, it's. Sorry, no, like being by saying no to me, teo fine.\n\nspk_2 : So then, after game, all this girl asks for a receipt.\n\nspk_1 : Simple, simple request, and\n\nspk_2 : lord was like, i'm a lord. My word is good, you're offending me. So he gave it all back to school, that cool, picking a pisser, walking out the door, and then he stopped and it came back, and he put it on the table. I said, lord, your word is good enough.\n\nspk_1 : Familiar and four hundred thousand dollars. Forty thousand, yeah, so that way, you learned george gardner's like fuck over stand. Thank god, this idiot.\n\nspk_2 : So fucking easy. So the next transition, right? The next day, jingle said no. It was some of the shares of the stock, saying he trusted lord gordon and basically apologizing and gruff. So, not only is he taking on guys money with the guys. Apologize.\n\nspk_1 : Guys are sorry, but not getting it. So\n\nspk_2 : gold came over then and said he was looking forward to the great prize of eerie stock over the next few days after lord gordon took over the board. So the big idea is that he's been taken with a board. You say we're going to tell us money into best in and then this toxin could go up to grand on. Then he told lord gordon, he was like, you're gonna make a million lord gordon said that's a lot would be fine. Selling to stock for half of that gold was like, really you really but a train with trees of others, doc and nor gordon was, like, sure, you could trade me some other stock way Celtic als and he could have the stock had already given him to hold on to so now it's it's so it's not a hole waiting,\n\nspk_1 : drops these things about himself. Then people pick up like he's throwing away these thoughts, like just do himself muttering like\n\nspk_2 : this. Just i'm gonna get stuck.\n\nspk_1 : Just a lot of walks to the window. Just a little, just like me, you know? I mean, i'm just gonna tell you. Perfect property is swimming in a perfect problem anyway. Shall we have some tea? What did you want, teo way.\n\nspk_2 : We're just saying, way\n\nspk_1 : soil, a delicious cucumber sandwich and tea session with thiss my lord, you're right, well, I mean, if you want, I had to bring in,\n\nspk_2 : I would like to know more about your property.\n\nspk_1 : Well, I just have a ton of green property, and i've got letters to prove it. I mean, if you're interested, i'll sell it to you. Good glass of all the money. You give me all the money and take what you want from this, made a pile of shit. Great, good luck. I mean, I have\n\nspk_2 : the deeds to the way\n\nspk_1 : you know what? How dare you, you i'm sorry here. Sorry, sorry, I know that's my fault now, it's, just my phone. This communication should weigh, not scott. She knows what i'm doing. Shake. Cool! That he\n\nspk_2 : handed over his resignation as president and director of the eerie railway. Come. And to lord gordon. Dork, like I had nothing to do with the company. And he now had over half mine or the ghoul securities and cash in the back. She has known each other for one week. Now. It's, not logical. Expectation is shit is gonna happen. Super fax.\n\nspk_1 : I would hope that would be something like that would help me think things are about to go crazy.\n\nspk_2 : But things did not happen to profess nothing\n\nspk_1 : that's weird, because that's a lot.\n\nspk_2 : All that happened was lord gordon sold six hundred chairs of theory and pocketed it, and then five thousand cherries oil creek on the philadelphia stock exchange. Okay, because of that word got out, it's something. I don't know how cool that is. Worship might not be on the up and up.\n\nspk_1 : What were the red flags? Through there. A. A\n\nspk_2 : quick investigation confirmed it. So we'll stop the sales stock immediately even rented a suite of apartments at the metropolitan hotel, right next to lord gordon gordon. Cool, summon is eyes powerful friends in new york. They have discussion, and then they sent for the superintendent of police. So horace green handle tails. Horace greeley was asked to be the goat in the tomb, and horace told lord gordon, since he was a gentleman of high rank, he wouldn't want to get caught up in some ugly controversy, should just return the money and forget trying to help gould or the eerie railroad. They're just not work there clearly. Fuck it's, yeah, right or against. So he said, if you give up the money he got for golden corn afterwards, right? Okay, lord gordon gordon demanded to see j cool, but gold refused to see him, and after a few hours, lord gordon gave up the two hundred thousand and most of the securities. But the stock that he had a soul already was obviously missing. So then google that lord gordon gordon arrested for obtaining money under false pretenses. Okay, lord gordon hard, two lawyers, one of whom was daniel sickle.\n\nspk_1 : I represent gordon, and i'm gordon.\n\nspk_2 : And decided to split the case way would like to be defendants. Everything.\n\nspk_1 : Killed. I'm doing some sort of. I can tell teo before there's, always two of us. You go on.\n\nspk_2 : So learn gardeners to lord. One of them was daniel sickles, star of dolphin person. Two thirty four. He killed his wife's lover and then walked out on its the first insanity defense. Right. So he's. In this\n\nspk_1 : he's he's, the lawyer\n\nspk_2 : of glory garden,\n\nspk_1 : it actually makes sense.\n\nspk_2 : Three big magnets medics from one was vanderbilt posted lord gordon gordon. Spot, of course, my lord, i'm so sorry you're going through this. Some\n\nspk_1 : people are saying you're not claim to be. It's natural. Yeah. Tripoli you know who you are? Words are missing. More noise based.\n\nspk_2 : So so at the rich guys help mouth and jingle. This friends can't believe that anyone would help lord gordon gordon, after what you've done is clearly fraud. Is\n\nspk_1 : anyone doing j about his decision making? Is that really what the fuck happened in the last week to you? Sorry,\n\nspk_2 : I noticed. I mean, he's got so much money, it's. Interesting. You did there's. Usually they would let it go and just be like people. Take\n\nspk_1 : it on the chin. Yeah, that's, kind of a figure, in a way,\n\nspk_2 : so sorry, so so, because lord gordon gordon had these other back guys, other rich guys backing him, right? Yeah, build whatever. So now he's super leads into being innocent, as I was claiming he's being abused, right? Yeah,\n\nspk_1 : you play victim, so get out of the victim's hold. Thank you.\n\nspk_2 : So the case goes to trial in under two months, because tell america used to work. It used to kind of make sense of\n\nspk_1 : the problems, but like that, that make sense to months,\n\nspk_2 : it's, like eight years, relations on the stand, lord gordon gordon told about\n\nspk_1 : what, when he's on the stand, is anyone like he's, not really, or everyone's, just like burt, what do you think? So how are\n\nspk_2 : you gonna prove he's? Not really. I guess you would think\n\nspk_1 : that, like me, there's lawyers involved is a lawyer now, like this isn't handing up because it doesn't exist, so\n\nspk_2 : you just start calling people in england. Do you know, lord, going like they need to have a trail of all their trash has on a man's dream? God, so easy for you to go back in time, is what I would do that.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, well, you can pull it off.\n\nspk_2 : How much grift anybody now. So I understand, he told about what he can to america and all the land. Ian bought minnesota and his ancestors, the great gordon's of scotland, he said. And they said the eerie stock wasn't in his name, but in his corporation's name, so right, scrooge\n\nspk_1 : mcduck, so they can get him on that. So\n\nspk_2 : they searched the stock, and whatever his name is against. Something you should know\n\nspk_1 : is that my name isn't a business thing. Yes, I\n\nspk_2 : see. Thie, uh, the attorneys asked a lot of us relatives back in scotland, and he answered every question and was described as, quote, unconcern. Yeah, but after his testimony, cool cable to all the people is large. It had mentioned in court wayne what every person that he mentioned that day in court and england's got france jiggle, center wrote down. And then he and then went attempted corroboration. And they went straight to cable, the\n\nspk_1 : only cable network around in the front.\n\nspk_2 : So not one of the people had heard of lord gordon gordon, and they said they had nothing to do with the great gordon family of scott. Okay, this is what I wanted, right? Justice. Well, just\n\nspk_1 : a movie. Attempted something other than like that sounds pretty good.\n\nspk_2 : So gold shut up at court the next day, ready to end gordon gordon once and for all. It's. Still way. Guard. Guard. Guard was gone. Finished testifying. He got on a train and went\n\nspk_1 : to canada. Strange. Oh, god! The\n\nspk_2 : case was considered. Quote ended.\n\nspk_1 : Go! Justice. God, you lost everything. Wait!\n\nspk_2 : What's, weird. Is he buried here? You're all run up there,\n\nspk_1 : make sense there. You must not be sleeping.\n\nspk_2 : Ghoul wasn't done. He offered twenty five thousand for the rest in return, is he\n\nspk_1 : in a pant and gordon constable? Mustache.\n\nspk_2 : Golson investigators to europe and that's. What every everyone learned of his past as hubert hamilton and lord glenn care. Turns out the stolen diamonds from true was in hamburg and london, and that they were valued at over one hundred thousand and that has been in seed. Money came to us. Okay, shocked to hear this. So this news arrived in Minneapolis, and they were not pleased. Train. Quote. Half a dozen sturdy citizens resolved to get even with the\n\nspk_1 : do. From sturdy stock. Half a dozen cynics. Eight people. Six sixes. I'm in the zone, the arithmetic, ists, it's, literally carry than nothing. Holy shit, just asked to six. Is that make up that? Doesn't you have any idea what that means? And doesn't mean six and six? These twelve, isn't it? That's, what my board says, looking all that yard. Being called Denver, i'm exhausted. Today. Okay, well, every time. Twelve. What? I won't talk anymore. Downside of being a specialist. I can relate. Hey, man, can I\n\nspk_2 : have half a dozen schools? So the existence of Minneapolis want to get even with these pseudo lord so grossly imposed on their hospitality. But word came that he was now in for gary, manitoba.\n\nspk_1 : It is not for you. No.\n\nspk_2 : This is fifty miles north of the minnesota canada border. So they organized a party. Minneapolis. The mayor authorized the chief of police to go. That team of fast horses was hired. Again. There's. Nothing worse in this time,\n\nspk_1 : you. Took a while shooting. Let's. See fast horses, or do you want to do the crazy trip? No that's. When they're on acid, they're slow ones. True. They're\n\nspk_2 : cheap, but it's such a fucking bummer.\n\nspk_1 : It takes awhile. Yeah, well, because you need to wait for them to process what their lives are. Taking hours.\n\nspk_2 : So so goes the kidnapping party. Right? They're gonna kidnap him, bring him back. So they got to have grown ups. What? Get up. Kidnapper. Relax. So they got two man in tow. The fork aerial of california. So they find them on his porch. He's. There, just on the fucking cabinets. Got a cabin just on the porch. We're gonna take you. They dragged him into a bag, and they put him in a wagon, the dragon lady driver. They fucking head back for the us as fast as possible, and then they cross the border, and then they get in minnesota, and then they're overcome by a party of of people coming from for gary. Ok, come in and kill her like you took our god, right, so they they get him back. The canadians get my place, okay, and they take him back to canada on, then they also there are more rooms. They took the kidnappers, too.\n\nspk_1 : So don't get in a situation that way. There's.\n\nspk_2 : No rules and kidnapping so\n\nspk_1 : it's, all the things I fucking will talk to that guy. He's, a fine club is like there's. Too big one\n\nspk_2 : season, you know, so has a different yeah, thinking, thinking, you're getting now. So they put all the sturdy citizens of minnesota in irons, and they take him up tio, and they throw in a dungeon. One massive lord gordon gordon. But they but to them, it's, just a fucking canadian guy that they grabbed like they don't know any difference.\n\nspk_1 : They're not even freaking out over the fact\n\nspk_2 : he's. Just around. They think that they came up, grabbed\n\nspk_1 : the guys, thought they were gonna say, like, you can't do that to the king of malaysia. No. Yeah. So,\n\nspk_2 : guys from minnesota and telegraph the mayor of Minneapolis, quote, we're gonna help fix coming once. Soon. Souness when the people minnesota here about this, they're fucking furious. And they start talking about raising an army and any across the water. Dan it's. Then they talked about it. So it was like, you know. No. He's coming up. I know, I know you lost your senator. Ok, is in the dungeon, but we'll have a\n\nspk_1 : good season. The state of bengal this year, with their new center, because your lesson is kind of guy are doing to you. But I have him back by the end of this season. A picture of this place.\n\nspk_2 : This is the guys in new york who would put up his bond money. Right? Vanderbilt. The other guys, which he's give doubt on. They got a judgment based on an old english law that said they could go into canada and legally take gordon back. Okay, okay, jump. So the mayor Minneapolis then headed up to get his kidnapping party out of jail. Others. It gets up there, there's. Lots of threats on both sides. The fucking screaming, yelling canadians, trying to make a deal, then told the mayor he could have the prisoners. And he bought a piece of land for forty thousand five.\n\nspk_1 : Gordon gordon. What you want. But if\n\nspk_2 : he bought a piece of land for forty thousand five hundred that belonged to the attorney general, they let teo\n\nspk_1 : Minneapolis go over invested. He needs a little bit of his money back. So maybe by then, we'll let you take that guy. Good offering it's. Not bad. I only offer. Relax here. We're sick and tired of being your community in our prison store. Let's, take a trip. Well, I should deal with it, putting in for a second. Take a dollar, not trying this even before notches work, but just wear it sells hockey season, right? I don't offer your team a lot better. We have a center in captivity. Rooth want to tell you ubers?\n\nspk_2 : So mayor now exposed the fourteen thousand five hundred offer for land to the media and the media. So with no resolution, the mayor and the governor of minnesota went to washington, d, c to talk to president grant about what was happening.\n\nspk_1 : She says. He's busy. Do what you're talking about. Go get your fucking weirdo! Why we're here.\n\nspk_2 : Country. Go get your fuckin center! Jesus christ cares about fucking hockey way. Give us you the rest of america isn't fucking. Way to take all the hockey teams and put them in the places you go, fuckers. Because it turns out that's where all the money is good. The people with the money. But they live in the places where it's hot. So you make our way. Take it! Fuck you! That's. The old sand don't live in the cold. So president grant was actually very upset. It is that they promised to get the men released now, when the mayor said they had been caught and taken into u s territory. So granted, first was like you said, he's, like, okay, yeah, there's things. You're trying to kidnap a guy. And then they took everybody with the fun. And then then they were like, yeah, but they were already in us territory. Wait, of course. Assistant secretary bancroft david then told them to former regiment and seized the border police and hold them until our address was obtained. She shave your gordon gordon fucking issue. Yeah, but the governor and mayor went back, and they decided to be more level headed. Just classic fucking minnesota, that's. All right, that's. We can talk this out, right? I think that cooler heads have prevailed. The first time I ever came to minnesota, I came from new york. And I lived in brooklyn. And they came out walking the streets. Strangers with high. You're in trouble. It's a nice day. Keep moving, motherfucker! So the mayor, governor of minnesota, went to see the canadian prime minister, and he decided there was no reason the prisoners should not be given bail. So bail was emilie obtained. All the guys from minnesota, including the senate, were released, and they went back to minnesota. No, Denver like that, which makes bad. We got like I will be fine. Grand Canyon going peeling back. The three of you guys is it's out of the running, man. So so those guys, you're back in minnesota. So actually, of those guys, three would become congressman from minnesota and to become minnesota governor.\n\nspk_1 : So that way we get it. I'm fucking serious with this shit. I'm just thinking about leaving, so\n\nspk_2 : the international conflict was over. But there was still a twenty five thousand dollars reward for lord gordon gordon out there on where we're going to new york, that he was now holed up in a cottage near toronto, so extradition papers were produced in washington, d, c to toronto. Policemen were sent to get him, and they walked in. They found lord gordon gordon asleep in his house. He looked up at them and said, quote, yes, do you want me?\n\nspk_1 : Right? This'll looks for real. This way, you infront season. Maxie's, anyone? So\n\nspk_2 : he then asked if he could sleep longer because it wasn't noon yet. Arrest the request was denied. He was not sure locked as was always his way. He got himself dressed and then told the officers he had for gotten. Is captain because it was so cold out. Toronto police quote. He got dressed, it was all ready to go with the exception of a scotch he called\n\nspk_1 : for a bloody hell spent forget my head. If it wasn't screwed on, I may\n\nspk_2 : have rushed into the better to get it where he got the revolver, I do not know I was standing in the door within four feet of him. The next thing I saw was his turning around with his back against the wall with your revolver in hand that made a russian torn him to prevent his shooting. I expected was meant for myself as I was about about getting hold of him. The gun went off. He made some remark while holding the revolver in his hand, but I did not catch the meaning. He sank down against the wall just as I got to hold him. I saw the blood coming out of his left ear. That was the first I noticed afterward saw the wound in his right temple. I believe he was dying fast, was dead, really.\n\nspk_1 : Contain the dark story. You know, like, like, figure out, what was happening was like, I was pretty sure I was shot. Was yeah, just wasn't sure what's going on. I don't know. Twenty. I was expecting no. Fifteen minutes later, my burner informing me. Actually not. It was like a bird. But the suspect, under arrest for murder, there was no need. Burn cities going, I said. He's gone he's fast. Report. Then we randomly rested. What's going on? I don't have been shot. I was. A lot of dying. Ice. And you don't know what dinos is, what I call that's for. Man. This clinton ride that way. She's. A fascist classic, minnesota. Holy shit! Well, that's fun. Yeah, that was fun. That was. I'm sure somebody didn't. Gordon gardens air here. That's, right? Wait! Be in. Albany, new york, and austin, texas, go to my website. You? No! Right? No. Oh, yeah, quick, no! You don't. Really? Okay. Bye. No. Good. Why? Where? Yeah, yeah. I really like you. Keep your money. I want to. Yeah. Yeah.

interesting benjamin les was\n\nspk_1 : born in a small cottage in comfort a county excess about sixty miles outside of london\n\nspk_0 : oh no no no hello sy has me boy there that's wrong is me i'm ben i'm lying again obey me how you laying down someday i'm gonna have a clock named after me when I get nice and big are well well covered had four date\n\nspk_1 : households including quote nine poor person's\n\nspk_0 : nine poor persons or nine poor houses okay so s so there's a sense is for it's their need to take a census\n\nspk_1 : they're not on that they're not on the tax records because they're so poor so they're just like\n\nspk_0 : that's fairly shit right okay\n\nspk_1 : yeah sure the village chapel had a sheet of flayed human skin that hung on the door is a warning probably to poachers that plate caught a poacher but s o\n\nspk_0 : so they say sixty sixty\n\nspk_1 : hundred just went through ah like a\n\nspk_0 : dusk inhuman inhuman up on the front of the chapel don't do it again no weapon valance fuck it looks like sort of a big run states me cam. No we'll be damage certainly yeah but your\n\nspk_1 : father william had three kids from his first marriage his wife died andi married that he married a second our sorries first cousin mary\n\nspk_0 : that's what we call god's divorce back\n\nspk_1 : yeah yeah yeah yeah benjamin was the product of that marriage the quaker church would question whether was right quote to marry one so near kin benjamin but what he just said he was sorry on day already moved on what is it? So that was benjamin's dad benjamin was a third generation quaker okay he went teo ah bit of school and learn just the basics as faras quakers go we've discussed their early behavior in another episode which you probably remember so here's a quick recap because you remember anything they publicly ranted against established ministers right? They would go\n\nspk_0 : a lot of bells\n\nspk_1 : yeah they would go to the services of the church of england and wait for the minister to start speaking and then they'd stand up and start screaming and loudly denounced the speaker and the sermons was being unrighteous alright protesters yet astra turf ng they would don't astro turf Nashville serving is\n\nspk_0 : yeah yeah it's better for indoor\n\nspk_1 : okay they would doff their hats in the presence of a so called social superior. This was a huge breach of social etiquette at the time. Early quaker john pero said he'd been told not to take off his hat by god and quakers would also act out in public to shock people out of their sinful complacency ok right the whole religious services all over the place in barnes open fields in the streets they were known for things like, quote going naked for a sign or burning bibles in public\n\nspk_0 : interesting I mean refresh\n\nspk_1 : good going naked for a sign going over sign literally made going on public naked to symbolize the spiritual nakedness of society at large like this so you just got to see some hot bods you're like oh, that one's a quaker me ao I mean okay so quick what\n\nspk_0 : I really said this is just some creepy quaker watcher\n\nspk_1 : yeah yeah I think if there's skinny quakers walk around naked doesn't mean a lot of fucking creepy quick you're watching\n\nspk_0 : right? Yeah quick watch little pocket flogging we call it\n\nspk_1 : the groups called quick watch boy in many communities this created scandal and quakers are often sense to whipping or the stocks quakers also insisted that wicked lad's need not be obeyed\n\nspk_0 : I agree with the quakers\n\nspk_1 : I do too. In sixteen fifty five oliver cromwell issued a national proclamation to prevent heckling of ministers okay hundreds of quakers within prosecuting in prison between sixteen, sixteen, seventeen hundred quakers then profoundly changed that gave up the boisterous yellowy stuff became disciplined pacifists like they are today. Okay, benjamin lei however, stuck with the old ways.\n\nspk_0 : Okay, so he's right? I like this.\n\nspk_1 : So it's the sixteen nineties benjamin's father apprenticed him to a master glover in colchester\n\nspk_0 : well I mean is there a better vision for your future than becoming a master glover yeah that's great i'm going to make gloves perfect ones the best clubs you've ever seen and that is what his job is to make gloves\n\nspk_1 : well that's what he was trained as love's lovemaking was one of the stinking trades one of the stinking trace thinking it was called a stinking trade because\n\nspk_0 : I had to stick a trade that's kind of it really\n\nspk_1 : now what I dealt with the skin of dead animals so stay fucking rake like you came\n\nspk_0 : so you could make some mittens out of that guy that was put in front of the church if it's all right\n\nspk_1 : if you want to you you make me\n\nspk_0 : make a set of mittens out of hand grab grab a rash a shawl\n\nspk_1 : grab a rabbit throw a little bit on the inside and make a frightening so\n\nspk_0 : gloves out of it right\n\nspk_1 : hey did not like the job really benji was not into it hey said it took quote neither much strengthened or ingenuity well it's I guess it's kind of insulting frustrating is insulting to the club makers um\n\nspk_0 : I mean l l bean right now is just literally tweeting live\n\nspk_1 : it at nineteen benjamin left his glove apprenticeship and moved in with his half brother william and fordham. Benjamin took care of the sheep which he very much enjoyed\n\nspk_0 : okay, so what did he enjoy it like that? Yeah, didi, you just winked.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, I just assume if someone\n\nspk_0 : says he putting the sheep on like gloves,\n\nspk_1 : i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm thinking things through and think\n\nspk_0 : you've inferred that there was sexual should\n\nspk_1 : beliefs? I believe so. That's what i've referred laura. I just\n\nspk_0 : want a wee spelling in for I n f ur. Yeah. Okay. Just want\n\nspk_1 : to make sure maybe I just want to\n\nspk_0 : win because he is in for. So you made an inn here about his infer that's, right? I got to go buy a villa park\n\nspk_1 : in seventeen o three at the age of twenty one, benjamin moved to london for the next twelve years. He spent months at a time sailing on a ship.\n\nspk_0 : Okay, is that just the right of passes? And I think you always have to do around this.\n\nspk_1 : I think I think everybody is, like, all right, i'll go work on,\n\nspk_0 : but i'm gonna go being a ship for four years and I have shitty\n\nspk_1 : how you shit hired what's happening right now. Have a tired ship. You're a retired\n\nspk_0 : ship. Hi. Yes. I'm retired. Yes.\n\nspk_1 : This is the ship talking, huh? Yeah so on the ship he was around men of different ethnicities living in cramped quarters and he met men who had been slaves he met men who had been on worked on slave ships I got to know a lot about slavery and it had a big effect on okay in seventeen fourteen he joined the congregation of the devon shire house monthly meeting sure it's a quaker all the quakers call them meetings right right i'm gonna start using their calls d d hmm\n\nspk_0 : d hmm\n\nspk_1 : right sure in london there in london he remained a member of the d h mm but\n\nspk_0 : is that sam for\n\nspk_1 : the didn't share house but he attended the wheeler street grace church street the peel the bull hook hill a bullet mouth quaker meeting so he would just go to a bunch of quaker meetings okay when they didn't meet his standards he would confront the ministers\n\nspk_0 : so he's back to the old ways of\n\nspk_1 : the quack right benjamin confronted two ministers william suckled and richard price a different meetings because they were quote preaching their own words not god's truth he would yell out during their sermons and tell them quote to be silent and\n\nspk_0 : sit down wow during a sermon yeah boy theo to things I think a servant needs is standing and talking we're actually listening to this sit down would you shit down plays and shut up snow god said wait\n\nspk_1 : he told price he was a hypocrite okay the leaders at the d h mm had three friends talk to benjamin tenderly they said about his outburst and to encourage\n\nspk_0 : sort of pillow talk\n\nspk_1 : or something okay to encourage him to quote come to a sense of his offense\n\nspk_0 : one of these ministers just used learned crowd\n\nspk_1 : work they could you yeah I mean that's good\n\nspk_0 : shut it down\n\nspk_1 : don't come down to where you working\n\nspk_0 : slap the sheep off your cock\n\nspk_1 : there you go now benjamin refused is not down at the next worship service he was given a copy of an article drawn up against him two weeks later during the service it was read aloud as a public shaming\n\nspk_0 : okay and that was like a huge thing back yeah you're suppose that was like twitter outright\n\nspk_1 : quicker is we're not supposed to like rile up the other quakers like that support deal okay he still refused to quote join with the meeting in condemning his own behavior okay but he was sure he was right he's like\n\nspk_2 : no i'm on this I know i'm the only guy yelling at\n\nspk_1 : the minister's but i'm fucking on this right a month later benjamin gave the d hmm an apology and writing quote it appeared that friends have been grieved on my account which i'm sorry for and help my contact for the future will be such as to give no occasions to france but this is not much an apology for his behaviour he was just saying he said they felt bad\n\nspk_0 : he's not saying he's saying he's not saying he's done\n\nspk_1 : yeah sam is still doing\n\nspk_0 : hopefully in the future you're not so angry about all\n\nspk_1 : that basically so did the gentleman was like we're not this is not about taking this is not apology so he just kept doing it in seventeen seventeen he got engaged to sarah smith a fellow quicker sarah was a dwarf aunt had a hunchback okay one biography describes sarah as an intelligent and pious woman so I should I should also what benjamin looked like from biography rob her biographer robert of all benjamin stood on ly four feet seven inches in height his head was large in proportion his body the features of his face were remarkable and boldly delineated he was hunchback with projecting chest below his body became much contract that his legs were so slender as to peer almost unable to the purpose of supporting him he's also a dwarf\n\nspk_0 : so at this point i'm just going to picture this as a animated fairytale musical if that's okay great\n\nspk_1 : so to dwarf met in there and they're getting married to quicker doors okay course to mary sarah benjamin needed a certificate from the quakers stating he was clear was debt on the marital obligations so he's like free right so he's also disliked by the way deke workers of the dhd waiting quakers like the big hitters\n\nspk_0 : the big okay right okay\n\nspk_1 : at the di hmm that he was worried they were refused the certificate that he needed\n\nspk_0 : okay yeah that's what I would assume so we've got to do on your heckling past catches up with you\n\nspk_1 : that's right so you got a job on a ship and sail the salem massachusetts where he asked the local quaker meeting for a marriage certificate\n\nspk_0 : is that because they don't know him yeah but also\n\nspk_1 : it's super like your showing up like\n\nspk_0 : hi I just came from uh can I get a marriage to get like super obvious fuck you doing okay went to steal those forgot where we get into this guy just get a marriage certificate real quick huh well quite\n\nspk_1 : you just came here from\n\nspk_0 : america yes london london america\n\nspk_1 : to america and you immediately want a marriage certificate\n\nspk_0 : not immediately no\n\nspk_1 : why don't you get one of the place the with the meeting you were at in london\n\nspk_0 : gosh you know what that makes so much sense I completely forgot that that was an option but I guess you could say sometimes I have no idea what being a quaker about take that joshua wilson if you're hearing this meaning\n\nspk_1 : so the salem meeting wrote to the d hmm in london to\n\nspk_0 : check on him this is not again. This is a loss of ages\n\nspk_1 : you know the first of all stamps dot comes not around\n\nspk_0 : right that's what this is you're already doing the new tactic of ad I mean\n\nspk_1 : it's like it's like twelve weeks or something get across the water so s o that's you know he's there for a while till the land comes back so they get another get a letter back warning that benjamin is indeed a problem boy but somehow he still got their certificate and eventually on july tenth seventeen eighteen benjamin married sarah okay so he's not thirty six she's forty one okay things are still tense at the local meeting so they decided to move okay and they sell for barbados in the fall of seventeen eighteen you like yeah like move it was a place in america was the first place american have a quaker presence hey set up he set up a shop that would serve dockworkers so he's like you know certain food and stuff\n\nspk_0 : what do you mean he was cooking dockworkers and giving them to\n\nspk_1 : people he set up a shop he wasn't serving dock workers who was serving dog food thank god for\n\nspk_0 : a minute I thought he was cooking the dock\n\nspk_1 : work paris later barbados was the world's leading leading slave society the population was nine thousand people of european descent and more than seventy thousand african the worst but\n\nspk_0 : he's been affected by this the twelve months on the ship he's already\n\nspk_1 : super not into the whole slavery thing\n\nspk_0 : so when he sees seventh seventy thousand controlled by nine thousand hoity toity it's not great right and knowing that this is a guy was trouble biting his tongue\n\nspk_1 : yeah no he's not good at that all right thomas waldo wrote of it quote the english brought with them drunkenness and swearing that scotch imprudence and falsehood the welsh covenas and revenge the irish cruelty and perjury the dutch and danes craft and rusticity and the french dissimulation and infidelity so that's what that I thought of\n\nspk_0 : sure exhorted the best qualities\n\nspk_1 : from you're all the people you better there cool slavery defined barbados tons of money can for sugar plantations where slaves were forced to work eighteen hours a day without rest benjamin and sarah saw slaves so weak they fainted in the street on market day hundreds of slaves would come to town to sell stuff and steal what they could sometimes they're sarah I threw out food that had spoiled quote yet the poor creatures would come running and tearing to get a part of the scramble of that which I am sure some dogs would not touch much less heat of their poor bellies were so empty and so ravenous were they that I never saw a parcel of hounds more eager about a dead carcass dothan they always were\n\nspk_0 : well this is quite a\n\nspk_1 : picture yeah it's beautiful it's really it's just mankind at its best\n\nspk_0 : except his podcast is helpful for uh you know, white person morale I\n\nspk_1 : think well, you think it would be but but then we just get a lot of people on place is saying that we that white guilt is bullshit we should shut up with.\n\nspk_0 : Well, I think, dave, to be fair to their point. Enough already? Yeah. Sorry. Paige. Did I tell you what this is? What happened to me in a show about a month ago? I did a bit on dh after the show. Someone said you walk someone, someone left because they thought you were racist. Oh, my god. And for twenty minutes, I was stewing like, oh, my god, this is I was trying to think of where and I kind of had some idea, but I still was, like, reaching and then someone cleared it up and was like, no, it was a white lady who thought you were, like, shitting on white people's too much on I was like, I feel great. How about this?\n\nspk_1 : After how about after the last several hundred years that have happened? How about you sitting? Liston, listen to a little bit of shitting\n\nspk_0 : you, truly the audacity to be like we've been through enough of the last fifteen months really bad? How about recent history, mr? Oh, god, I think why people think, like, your history is like laptop porno, and you could just clear it before anyone comes and checks on you. So at\n\nspk_1 : the beginning, benjamin with last slaves who stole from him. But he quickly realized the slave masters were the real thieves, and he felt guilty. It does grieve me, quote, it does greet me to this day, considering the extreme cruelty and misery they've always lived under, he decided to speak with the slaves and\n\nspk_0 : level oh, what I know what a revolution in what the fuck whoa! Eyes out of his mind. Speak slave. He walked amongst them.\n\nspk_1 : They just be well, they just talked like us. They just speak the same words it's english that they've learned. So you're doing it now i'm talking to you, but this is also how you talk to them. I also no slave. Yeah, you know. So we all know it's because not all slaves called english like they they they've learned english, so they know english. We're a slaver and you know, i'm not slave. I'm just a guy that knows the queen's english. Your eyes are dead inside my heart is dead yeah yeah okay visit he decided to speak of the slaves and learn about their lives he got to know one man a cooper who made his master richard parrot seven shillings and six pence a day working sure\n\nspk_0 : today that's like forty shillings and nineteen\n\nspk_1 : according to benjamin the owner parent quote used to whip his negroes on monday mornings very severely to keep them in awe what so he was just like just start every monday start to we're\n\nspk_2 : going to start start we would beat them up\n\nspk_0 : that to send a message for the week yes it's sort of like a team meeting in like and like an ad agency same thing every day monday morning power\n\nspk_1 : together you're talking about we're gonna do that week sure we\n\nspk_0 : send a message by beating physically beating on\n\nspk_1 : him and beating your shirt one sunday night the slave took his life to avoid the next day's beating so that didn't work out for that like that that speech that idea the week speech obviously you do economics it's reaganomics it's trickle down economics benjamin wrote that many of the slaves quote are murdered by working hard and starving whipping, racking hanging burning scalding roasting another hellish ncis crime we're all routine so the lays began holding meetings at their home in sunday serving meals to crowds of slaves there they would denounce slavery pretty soon quote many hundreds of slaves turned up of course the white slave owners on the island were\n\nspk_0 : furious that I had left were\n\nspk_1 : right they tried to banish the lays from barbados but benjy began to worry that living around all of this this nightmare would eventually caused them to become accustomed to cruelty and he decided to make it his mission to end slavery so now two missions in his life one calling out false ministers and to abolishing slavery\n\nspk_0 : so far loving the tent pole\n\nspk_1 : yet slavery would have to take a back burner for a while as they were now going to return to england where there wasn't much slavery\n\nspk_0 : surely that was cool news to all the people all the slaves that but serving food to like yeah well unfortunately take a pause on this mission\n\nspk_1 : okay we'll see you\n\nspk_0 : later we're going to go cuss out some ministers for a year that's not really the same stay strong importance were also why can't eat food life's potion\n\nspk_1 : wait who's going away from who you were\n\nspk_0 : but surely it has to stay with someone fall\n\nspk_1 : of seventeen twenty delays return to london on worshipping at the devon shire house monthly meeting another\n\nspk_0 : month he started to shout the d hmm\n\nspk_1 : d h in the g hmm another month he started challenging the quaker ministers again in public first against the minister named zachary ralph after one meeting he said wrath was quote a drunkard and a swine when asked to elaborate by fellow quick quicker is benjamin said that wrath was quote drunk with wind and that he preached in his own spirit and not the spirit of truth\n\nspk_0 : drunk on wind yeah I think we have no leader who's like that\n\nspk_1 : huh the guy from taxpayer okay the german leaders ask benjamin to retract his comments and repent and he\n\nspk_0 : did dammit i'm damn well for two\n\nspk_2 : at the next meeting an\n\nspk_1 : article was read aloud in front of the congregation to shame benjamin they asked him to publicly renounce renounce his accusations and he said\n\nspk_0 : yes scott demon got him do\n\nspk_1 : s o they disowned him okay but benjamin just kept going to the meetings because being just just owned by a meeting on lee man hee couldn't attend the business meetings where group decisions are made by\n\nspk_0 : the quakers are like we buy our laws have been too inclusive\n\nspk_1 : yes so basically ever could still go to the worship services right couldn't be a part of the decisions sure\n\nspk_0 : doesn't really seem like that matters help this situation yeah\n\nspk_1 : two months later the d h n and tried again a quicker went teo benjamin's glover's workshop and gave him the article and benjamin look at the article and crumpled it up and threw it out the shop\n\nspk_0 : that's so great because you know that guy walked over there like benjamin what do you think of that you can surely tell now that you're in quite a bit of trouble j and toss, crinkle, crinkle toss that teo quicker when it took us quite a while, way worked on that it's. Also sunday, no it's rooms, only one copy,\n\nspk_1 : so the quicker went outside, picked it up, brought it back in the shop and put it on benjamin's counter, and benjamin just ignored it and the messenger. Okay, now, sarah benjamin decided to move again, this time to his native colchester, where around five hundred quake quakers belonged to the colchester two weeks meeting. Sure, t wn\n\nspk_0 : right where they would have a meeting every two weeks.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, um, after a very brief period, he started to attack the ministers. They're okay, the c t wn leaders, wrote the london committee of sufferings, a show.\n\nspk_0 : Step forward but what is your suffering of god has got a bit of gout score us where the counselor you've got god will not take a vote if this is an actual separate made what your diet than alcohol writes on dh sausages on the council deems this self inflicted sorrow suffering is so yes I would say it's an objection I would tell you of course you've got a terran good torrid cough i've got a bit of what coffee's the coffee's oh boy alright next move him put it on the dolly drag about langley oi keep sweeping oh tha the capital of sufferings is a great fear of this man we five he is indeed suffering I was sorry about shake me head like a dog way will not be oh god could ever close your eyes don't get into your eyes\n\nspk_1 : so they asked a lot of committee of sufferings which I just so mean to\n\nspk_0 : you don't want to be in the middle of that line\n\nspk_1 : no they asked what to do about benjamin saying benjamin was in a quote dark disordered condition sure now we're not sure what lennon wrote back but the ct w elders held a meeting and summon benjamin and he refused to come okay pretty music so they they sounded so now he's been owned by disowned by the d hmm? Sure ctw\n\nspk_0 : boy I bet those slaves on barbados would love to hear about something you know seriously think export\n\nspk_1 : dynasty was apologized repent you know back in although he technically wasn't a member of the c t w m because he couldn't join a new meeting until he made things right with d h m m\n\nspk_0 : this is so now he needs to go to the council of acronyms right\n\nspk_1 : so this is like a double secret disowning the colchester people didn't have to do anything you write ever actually in whatever okay star however was accepted into a smaller reading in colchester the cia have been\n\nspk_0 : the cm country you got\n\nspk_1 : country music medals that had an important role in history church in sixteen ninety two they had rejected the national trend among quakers toward separate meetings for men and women so they were more think that was a girl a little more progressive sure\n\nspk_0 : you know it's interesting that the vice president's still isn't okay with meetings like\n\nspk_1 : that is weird is weird but he says he can't drink around they can't be alone with his wife when there's alcohol around which means that he clearly fucked another woman at some point during\n\nspk_0 : the seventeenth or a bible\n\nspk_1 : or bible you might affect a bible they're the seventeen twenty sarah and a fellow minister would trouble for months at a time preaching to quaker congregations while benjamin went to see m m and c t w m meetings and just cause trouble sure he started purposely keeping his hat on when he prayed this is also an old school move crackers have been into keeping their head on the sixteen hundreds of protest but this had changed now benjamin was the only one that was doing it right ok, so so they're all freaking out that he's keeping his hat on charles\n\nspk_0 : shape I mean, I don't think we need to go down another one of these wise is also he's fucking mad name also hat harry's your prayer going to get to god if you've got a hat on fucking her own it's blocking your signal nice fucking ridiculous man.\n\nspk_1 : So on may seventeen twenty three the c t w a meeting drop charges against benjamin okay benjamin found out and refused to come after a couple\n\nspk_0 : hours later it sort of is one of those tree falling in the wood question you keeps giving someone charges and they totally ignore them. Have you charged anyone but me\n\nspk_1 : think so. Yeah. Also they can keep coming what's the charge ah couple's letter benjamin got in trouble at an angelic in church he was, quote, indicted for depriving the sacrament of the lord's supper. He pleaded not guilty the judge\n\nspk_0 : does that mean\n\nspk_1 : I guess he went in the same thing? You\n\nspk_0 : just ate a bunch of the body of christ and then pounded the wise\n\nspk_1 : what i'm talking about\n\nspk_0 : come on,\n\nspk_1 : I think he went in during the sacraments are fucking screaming I say he's not itself is not guilty the judge as him if you appear at the next session for trial he said no I\n\nspk_0 : think this is a much better time as faras trials god not busy that time\n\nspk_1 : coming to the judge offered to release him on his own recognizance\n\nspk_0 : you know what that is\n\nspk_1 : it no ok eso he's put in jail\n\nspk_0 : okay rather have that then well ha ha I got you may remember the fucking jae shin freed a call they suck on that way r\n\nspk_1 : could be walking around i'm\n\nspk_0 : not why because i'm right yeah\n\nspk_1 : by seventeen twenty three benjamin's protests and general ship causing behaviour was becoming a national issue okay the quaker yearly meeting is sent a letter to all localities quote against any disorder of keeping on he hat in time of prayer or other appearances of\n\nspk_0 : disunion okay as long as they're nipping the most important thing in the bud I mean that's that's what match that should get the hats squared away\n\nspk_1 : the cwm was seriously done with benjamin he was still yelling and wearing his hat okay so late you up another indictment against him which included quote gross and abdomen abominable practices a domino practice is different the plan was to read it out loud where benjamin disrupted a meeting so now they have a standard\n\nspk_0 : now is there anything there? They're going to combat his distracting by adding another voice that the\n\nspk_1 : distraction yes in time, he yells, their going to read a thing about\n\nspk_0 : him. I read from a pre prepared statement that I said I would read over if benjamin lie was to speak in one of these meetings. Cia official is a douchebag. The minister has no idea what he talks about. I will keep my hat on\n\nspk_1 : on may thirteen, seventeen, twenty for benjamin spoke in the women's quarter in the great meeting houses.\n\nspk_0 : He misses down firing it. Yeah, this is, you know,\n\nspk_1 : that was it. The cwm fucking lost it. Okay to pick three quakers, quote to keep him out of the gallery for you, future.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, ye serious now. Eurgh!\n\nspk_1 : So he's, so fucking annoying that he had gotten pacifist to use physical force to keep him out. So\n\nspk_0 : he invented bouncers. He in a backwards way.\n\nspk_1 : He really did the c t w sent to members, too, to try to talk it out with him. The benjamin. If you talk to him in the december, he agreed to have his case decided by friends as long as they were impartial about him and the issues. So friends who are empires, friends is what quakers called each other. Okay, february seventeen, twenty five, benjamin went before an eight man committee. He was contrite and seemed to really want to be re admitted, and they refused. Okay, so he went back to the d h mm with his hat in hand, so to speak. He wrote them a letter addressed to dear and loving friends. Okay, that was the highlight of the letter. He then went on to explain with the problems with the meetings were, as he had been told by god, and then he would have to point them out during meetings.\n\nspk_0 : Okay, so it's pretty okay. Not a great deal.\n\nspk_1 : And he ended it with, quote, I remained to your friends, your sincere, true and loving, although exercised and at times sorrowful and much afflicted, brother. Okay, he petitioned for reinstatement to d hmm, and I guess hmm said no, your letter was fucking okay he kept trying over the next year and at one point the d h and m wrote to the c t w m saying if they'd forgive him the d h mm would too\n\nspk_0 : interesting so this is like if mom says you can go\n\nspk_1 : yeah but the ct w m said no he was still keeping his hat on and yelling and ministers and and he was now disrupting churches all over town the jellicle presbyterians independents a baptist\n\nspk_0 : I mean there's really no problem with his with the disown the nature of his public like it's not really stopping him from doing what he wants okay\n\nspk_1 : it made seventy twenty six benjamin wrote a long letter teo the c t w m apologizing and saying he was wrong and weary and done with this nonsense on the ct jeb was like now we're good\n\nspk_0 : yeah I think this needs a follow up letter\n\nspk_1 : after that there were no church records of benjamin or sarah for three and a half years now she's in good standing this whole time like she's like a minister like they love her okay then in november seventeen twenty nine sara wrote to the d hmm it turns out the ladies were moving to philadelphia and need a benjamin to be reinstated so they could join a quaker community in america. Okay the d hmm asked the c t wn for advice and they said look he's still paying the ass but he was never a member of our meeting because you had already disowned him so he couldn't make him a member so it's always been on you and it's really none of our business in the end\n\nspk_0 : okay so now reinstate\n\nspk_1 : so the c t w m meeting then found that benjamin was trying to join the sea mm okay which is the local little culture\n\nspk_0 : right yeah yeah\n\nspk_1 : on now they're pissed\n\nspk_0 : okay so he almost maybe had it but then they found out about the sea mm\n\nspk_1 : yeah now he's like joining the rivals right right now it's now he's on the baseball very esther uniting in manchester city situation sure so now they get involved even though he just said it was none of their business right and they sent members to the cm to let ever know the bench was a pain in the ass and he had been disowned by the d h mm okay cm didn't care and decide to grand benjamin membership\n\nspk_0 : right like he's fucking in he's a party animal one this one we like him\n\nspk_1 : and then richard price was the minister benjamin who attacked fourteen years earlier okay jumps in the fray and he tried to talk to see mm out of granting the laser travels certificate so they have to get they have to then you try to be able to travel I guess of there quick\n\nspk_0 : so essentially they're trying to get like citizenship to a quaker state.\n\nspk_1 : You know trying to get out to be able to travel to know quicker state\n\nspk_0 : but they're like there's paperwork there's hundreds of bras as\n\nspk_1 : fucking shit loads of work but the c m m n c m m said prices letter was not cool and totally irregular so\n\nspk_0 : they're words because they sound like the kind of cool if they did I wouldn't\n\nspk_1 : use not cool with me using a regular okay so price wrote to the c t w m who technically had absolutely nothing to do with it so the c t w got back into it and tried to stop the cmm from giving the certificate okay but the cmm una unanimously voted to a border so if you get to the lays that would permit them to move to pennsylvania and join a quaker congregation so it's over there go okay so basically just a bunch of fucking people were like\n\nspk_0 : dating dumb not him you fucking lied right but then the hole in the wall I was like yeah he's fine he's all right not bad he likes biscuits\n\nspk_1 : yeah they left in march seventeen thirty two took eleven weeks benjamin spent a lot of time talking to the semen and hearing their voice other stories about the slave trade now philadelphia is the largest seon americans told thousand people the quaker colony was the second largest in the world. Okay, benjamin set up set up is a merchant sound books okay and then benjamin sir joined the philadelphia monthly meeting the pm god\n\nspk_0 : damn it the pm ok\n\nspk_1 : deal's a go on them we're\n\nspk_0 : done with the cm the cia and little pop\n\nspk_1 : up a tiny bit of cash for church leaders lead religious and political life in the city in the colony they're all wealthy landowners and many quakers owned slater I had a feeling that life is a big shock to benjamin coming from colchester where slavery was rare one in ten people in philadelphia where in slaves eso benjamin's abolitionist principles were fucking fire back up lovely he discovered half of the members of the p m m own slaves he was trying to live the best life he could he made his own closed two of what exploiting the labour of others including animals he refused to eat food or wear clothes made by slave labor well he refused to use sheep's wool so all of\n\nspk_2 : his clothes were made out of unguided spun flax\n\nspk_0 : a man I love this guy\n\nspk_1 : yeah it's just motherfucker on\n\nspk_0 : it feds find out that she's human beyond the human that was harmed in the process of this was me but the thing about\n\nspk_1 : sheep is like they actually like you have to share them is like if that all that wool grows then they just don't\n\nspk_0 : they become enormous balls yeah bye yeah but I mean yeah maybe it was a tortuous process or\n\nspk_1 : something i'm sure it wasn't the most humane hey also went everywhere barefoot well to his give crew flak suit and he's got no shoes like wind hoff hey dressed in height colored plainclothes in a white hat okay so okay okay he was nearly a vegan cheese before the word was invented he decided to become a vegetarian then he killed the ground hog that had destroyed his garden he cut the ground hog into little pieces and nailed parts to the four corners of his garden. What sort of okay can shit okay he was then overcome with remorse and were announced the killing and eating of animals and he walked everywhere so as not to use horses says the story ground how dae so he so you fucked up he fucked up a count around highways that are like in just appearance\n\nspk_0 : and he treated it how like a a queen used to treat their enemies that's just sort of staked it up in certain areas to show it on\n\nspk_1 : and then as happens to one who cuts a ground hog into many pieces and nails it all over the place you start to go you know this is this was too much you\n\nspk_0 : go but what is my life yeah what what do I stand for? I got to\n\nspk_1 : say just looking at me in this position i've gotten pretty weird. Yeah, maybe have to reevaluate.\n\nspk_0 : Yes, I mean, I grounded ground hard. Yeah, okay, so I love this\n\nspk_1 : benjamin's very against materialism he said it was, quote the chief ist of the seven devils and supreme ruler head and governor of hell babylon and bottomless pit she's she's really he's pretty he's pretty he's\n\nspk_0 : got the language of a\n\nspk_1 : sorcerer. Now he goes pretty hard core against us.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, on all or nothing kind of guy\n\nspk_1 : yet, but he thought all covetous men are quote, beasts, blasphemers, liars, thieves and murderers as well. A cz ah, I don't know what that word is has changed, sure, but it's bad and that the wealthy were the masters of misrule of both politics and religion. Wow. So he doesn't like the people who want one stuff.\n\nspk_0 : One of the people are obsessed with materialism and a, uh a gap in class.\n\nspk_1 : Oh, I always say my I was raised in a family that always said, listen to the guy in the flak suit.\n\nspk_0 : Yeah, listen, the man who was in the h e a stout pheasants, right? Yeah, it won't take his hat off\n\nspk_2 : and he thought america was much worse than colchester quote, I do believe here in this land of\n\nspk_1 : america as selfish, sorted, greedy, covetous, earthly minded people of almost all names as any in the world\n\nspk_0 : well, dave, then he could just stay in the locker room well, he's right right some patriot you are sometimes I wonder if you know what it means to be a patriot do you know what it means to love this country don't it means you're not allowed to ask questions and point out flaws okay keep your head down shut up do your job trust the process it's bad your head's up put it down.\n\nspk_1 : Okay that's fair hey did not like the way quaker society was changing involvement in business and land speculation was quickly making quakers wealthy he believe rich slave owning quaker ministers were destroying his religion. Covetousness was probably benjamin's number one shit talking term quaker ism acquired rescue from slavery from capital san\n\nspk_0 : so he is basically saying the quest for items and status he is the biggest problem. Okay, catch imagine that doug and I mean it I mean really it's good stuff to fathom\n\nspk_1 : so to bring awareness bender started holding public protests against quote, men of renown when winter came he stood at the doorway to the quaker meeting house his right leg had no shoe or sock and he stuck it in the snow. Okay, interesting start when a fellow when his fellow quakers past and told them he would get sick doing that benji would say, quote ah, you pretend compassion for me but you do not feel for the poor slaves in your fields who go all winter half clad. Well, then they i'm i'm just gonna go in time well yet head inside.\n\nspk_0 : Okay, so someone is holder, right? So someone's out there making logical points. Mike, wait! That can't be accepted\n\nspk_1 : that quaker meetings, if anyone who owned a slave trying to speak benjamin started jumping up and yelling, quote,\n\nspk_0 : there's, another negro master! Wow,\n\nspk_1 : he's! The best great! He started going, teo\n\nspk_2 : different churches and ranting at ministers\n\nspk_1 : who are also becoming very offended. Sometimes he just show up wearing a sack cloth to show his humility. Before god, some churches started having him physically removed. She sucks. I mean, he's really going for yet he's all out during a sermon, one preacher said he heard a voice from heaven and benjamin yelled, quote from my life and preaching, I question whether thou ever hurst a voice from heaven\n\nspk_0 : in my life. And if thou didst, I am sure that has not obeyed it. Like god.\n\nspk_1 : The creature grabbed a bullet and chased benjamin out of the meeting.\n\nspk_0 : Wow! What? I mean, how is a whip? Cut through a sack? Wait! We could find that out. Back in\n\nspk_1 : england, the colchester two weeks meeting was still trying to get benjamin banished from the quakers.\n\nspk_0 : Wow! So they've moved on there. Okay they're not scorned or anything\n\nspk_1 : they had made an official complaint to the essex quarterly meeting the ruled benjamin quote was not a proper member of the meeting and should not have been given a joint certificate to go to philadelphia but the cia cnn did not give two shits they still send a copy of the joints to get to the fill a few women's meeting which had requested it okay so cmm is just like not playing ball there right no fuck off right there's a little section cwm want benjamin to suffer they wrote a letter quote to friends and philadelphia are elsewhere in america concerning the irregular certificate benjamin lay had from colchester monthly meeting they pushed philadelphia to write and send their own letter to anywhere that benjamin might settle down okay so so they're just like this\n\nspk_0 : is an a p b\n\nspk_1 : score yeah eight be scorched earth right this's like these on the ten most fbi wanted list\n\nspk_0 : right quicker released wanted list both of these\n\nspk_2 : both of the letters ended up in the hands of church leader robert\n\nspk_1 : jordan junior a slaveholder who fucking hated benjamin well so march seventeen thirty for the lazy and moved eight miles north to abington at this point benjamin was well known in philadelphia quote the name of the celebrated christian philosopher was familiar to every man, woman and nearly every child in pennsylvania his antics got attention and his protests were written up in the press who's making noise, right delays, built the home home, although from description that was in the philippine choir. I\n\nspk_0 : can't imagine what his highness. They must try to keep\n\nspk_1 : it pretty meager. And not that great, right, quote, the\n\nspk_0 : still the bunch of sacks\n\nspk_1 : it's, worse on the slope of the hill, he had his cave.\n\nspk_0 : What? Okay, I just no. Okay, as\n\nspk_1 : well as one for his wife, the roof of which\n\nspk_0 : so they had, like, sort of dick van dyke couples beds, but caves. A sort of like all right, fire's out\n\nspk_1 : the roof of which he covered with that straws and limbs of trees. The spring near the cave, he\n\nspk_0 : was ahead. Forts?\n\nspk_1 : Yeah. Basically, the spring of the cave, he walled up for his household use. And near the cave he planted for black walnut trees, which marked the place. For many years they lived entirely upon vegetable and grain diet and cultivated garden and fruit orchard around his cave. So it sounds like he literally fixed up a cave. Yeah, sometimes it's described as a college, but other times as a cave. So I think it's, a cave lady, fixed up to look like the nice change, I think outside it looked like a cottage. You go inside. It was a case,\n\nspk_0 : right? Okay. So he's, living like the hobbits in lord of the rigs.\n\nspk_1 : Another benjamin built the new home into a quote, natural excavation in the earth to afford himself a comm odious apartment. So it's a big case.\n\nspk_0 : Sure media so he's yeah right he's just he's just he's digging his home he's just a class he learned much from the ground hog\n\nspk_2 : is just a classic dwarf living in the\n\nspk_0 : case sure right all right I keep forgetting right okay\n\nspk_1 : the cave was spacious he had a library with over two hundred books\n\nspk_0 : okay i'm gonna tell you right now that I haven't heard a thing about this that I don't like okay yeah\n\nspk_1 : the books were his most prized possession only worldly goody carried about okay people started coming over to see how he's living quote life in agreement with nature love it he hosted big names like governor richard penn and benjamin franklin and his cave\n\nspk_0 : like benjamin franklin was in his cave\n\nspk_1 : any frank was friends with them\n\nspk_0 : is always in the cave\n\nspk_1 : he rolled by once in a while yeah cave buddies sure benjamin sarah needed the certificate so they would join the so they could join the abbington monthly meeting right so the longer they gotta get way got to get fucking approval again to get into the amex I am but then sarah died in seventeen thirty five at age fifty eight it was unexpected bedroom was devastated okay the approval process for the a m and continued though the pm and appointed to friends john john bring hearst and anthony morris junior to investigate benjamin's request. Ok. Both were slave owners.\n\nspk_0 : Well okay think we know where this is headed\n\nspk_1 : morris that actually banned the leader leading writer of pennsylvania's slave code ten years earlier it was called an act for the better regulation of negroes in this province\n\nspk_0 : like so we just always labeling these horrid things just look this way\n\nspk_1 : straight up their model the model we based everything on was barbados\n\nspk_0 : which we know had a great ratio\n\nspk_1 : also benjamin's trigger island the philadelphia bill also sought to control the free black community stating quote freed negroes are an idol stl awful people who afford ill example to other negroes\n\nspk_0 : there is such a contradiction even within that logic though the idea that you would then take thes quarter quotes lawful people and be like you work here you need to do physical labor it's all fucking bullshit I think again it just points to the the confidence of the wife\n\nspk_1 : white man is very confident yeah it also made it difficult for an owner to free a slave and interracial marriage is illegal so we can assume these two guys hated benjamin right yeah obviously so the letter from the c t w woman england about benjamin was all they needed and the pm revoked benjamin's membership okay but again benjamin just keep going to meetings and yelling about false ministers and\n\nspk_0 : slice and yeah okay so they don't have a real handle on how to deal with that. Yeah\n\nspk_1 : he said that any quicker on slaves bore the quote mark of the beast and should be.\n\nspk_0 : I think the rhetoric is getting stronger, if anything. He's fucking all. Yeah, yeah. After the\n\nspk_1 : death of sirrah. So after the death of sarah benjamin's anti slavery activism picked up even more\n\nspk_0 : right okay and she's got time on his hands and a new cave that it's starting to vote is like his work cave and play a little matter of an actual office\n\nspk_1 : based on what it sounds like she was she might settle them down a little bit so that was a settled\n\nspk_0 : down for sure right gotcha right no\n\nspk_2 : yeah and it worked okay bet between seventeen thirty five and seventeen forty three which were his pete protest years there is a proof quote profound shift in the attitudes of philadelphia quakers towards buying imported slaves\n\nspk_0 : wow okay\n\nspk_1 : at the time benjamin's ridiculed heckled and dismissed by quakers as being mentally deficient but he was making progress\n\nspk_0 : right? Ok that's cool yeah and I would also imagine that like the quaker heckles have nothing on his hackles so it's almost like\n\nspk_1 : you couldn't there's a story I took it out because this is long but there is a story of a guy fucking with him in the street and he just totally bested the guys like he's a smart dude but he's a dwarf and so I assume while quakers were pretty accepting they still just fucking but they didn't take him seriously or they were i'm sure he was his opinion was not as accepted have been just a regular looking person,\n\nspk_0 : right? Right. Probably why he identified with the disinfects rice\n\nspk_1 : you know he had empathy for people who who had to go through shit,\n\nspk_0 : which back then was treated as a disease that you had to go see out. Apothecary, if you suffer from empathy, that's, right way,\n\nspk_1 : get hung and burned for having everything. That's fun at one quicker meeting\n\nspk_2 : in horsham, pennsylvania, on april tenth, seventeen. Thirty seven bedrooms, sitting quietly when he was just grabbed and roughly carried out of the meeting solely based on his reputation. Okay, at another meeting, he was thrown into the street on a rainy day. So he came back and laid down in the mud. Right in front of the door. So every person leaving the meeting had to step over his\n\nspk_0 : body. Okay, interesting, right. Okay, so you just become a mud man. I\n\nspk_1 : mean, that's, fucking great, because, yeah, like, you're just making them do that makes them feel like a fucking\n\nspk_0 : not enough people play the swamp monster. Where if you'd just tell\n\nspk_1 : you what mud guys one of the best protest\n\nspk_0 : every yeah that's strong because people like they don't know how to deal with the mud man no yeah yeah\n\nspk_2 : and seventeen thirty seven p m m reported benjamin's interruptions were quote very troublesome an example quote for friends all you that are ministers of anti christ whether in pulpits or galleries you that are of the king of locus and are creeping out of the bottomless pit a little to see what mischief you khun due to mankind and service your king lucifer to see what good you get for your god your\n\nspk_0 : bellies I wish this guy was still hanging around a lot you know\n\nspk_1 : I mean he's great damn around right now\n\nspk_0 : yeah i'd be a good time\n\nspk_1 : we fucking on point\n\nspk_0 : yeah especially you still wear the mud\n\nspk_2 : it became pretty common for ministers to fly into a rage and having physically removed she\n\nspk_0 : so he is joe I mean he is public enemy number one yeah but also\n\nspk_1 : you you know these I mean these protests are a little more in your face but like you we take colin kaepernick's protest like those protests are are made to show what your enemy isthe right so he has exposed the nfl for what it is he's exposed you know trump and all these different people for what they are like your peaceful protest just brings out the rage and hate and then\n\nspk_0 : it's so it's so true that he did so little so to cause so much he literally took in tuscany and and that is enough lost their mind and the nfl has now completely well part of fumbled that they have no idea how to deal with that lose gobs of much trump has lost his mind the most these you know people who support this rhetoric of trump's and support him and it's all because ed conlin cabinet can't get signed all because he went on his knee and picked out his throw a little and that just drove yeah the white mosque quietly crazy\n\nspk_1 : so he's I mean he's a little more boisterous but he's also calling out slavery arterial ism which you\n\nspk_0 : should weigh have a little bit of leverage to if you're white in a situation like this even if he is like a different I mean he is allowed he's a lot and a little more wiggle\n\nspk_2 : room yeah so I became pretty common for ministers to fly into a rage and having physically remove\n\nspk_0 : its is very similar\n\nspk_2 : yeah they eventually pointed a constable to keep him out of meetings around philadelphia so\n\nspk_0 : now they haven't assigned guy\n\nspk_1 : fucking hired a benjamin lake cop right to onley patrol benjamin leg\n\nspk_0 : right okay\n\nspk_2 : soon to part from members of the pm drip a quote a testimony against him to be brought to the next meeting benji was given the opportunity to seek the reconciliation. The p m m ruled against benjamin they delivered that ruling to the mm and the an m ban him as\n\nspk_1 : well so his local okay now kicked him out right this was his fourth disowned but first london then colchester than philadelphia and now addington\n\nspk_0 : right? Okay\n\nspk_2 : like inequality right just dude in february seventeen thirty eight benjamin responded by beginning a forty day fast wow the plan was to only drink water I kept his regular routine on the ninth day he reported he was in good health one morning he walked eight miles to philadelphia to meet with his friend benjamin franklin franklin letter later said benjamin's quote breath was so acrid as to produce a suffuse shin of water in his eyes which was extremely painful\n\nspk_0 : and this is at a time when breath brother is at an all time love no breath at this time that this time was just like having like a horse shit and your nose every time someone spoke so everybody\n\nspk_1 : walked up to you like\n\nspk_0 : well yeah and then you'd speak and then go to bed now you have a guy was like oh but frankenstein\n\nspk_1 : talking about how bad the breast milk because that's just a given he's saying his breast mostly about its six meetings\n\nspk_0 : all right right his own eyes so these air he has right? I mean stink marks coming out of his mouth yet right? So\n\nspk_2 : he keeps hey keeps losing strength with the fast by the third week couldn't leave his cave and soon couldn't get out of bed.\n\nspk_0 : You don't say that it's not normal, even for this time it's not a normal statement, he couldn't because he was cave written at that point, he talked\n\nspk_2 : a friend into putting a loaf of bread on a table in his cave so he could test is will\n\nspk_0 : what's. Why does he have to do? He's needs to give himself biblical challenges.\n\nspk_2 : He's given himself a challenge. He could barely speak, but he kept saying, quote, benjamin that's see it, but thou shalt not eat it lights but his mental faculties began to fail. His friends started to feed him, and slowly he was brought back to life\n\nspk_0 : like baby burning him.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, probably. I would imagine you at\n\nspk_2 : that point okay after he would never try to fast again, though hey would always live a life of austerity now he'd been writing a book for two years. It demanded the immediate end of\n\nspk_0 : read on tables. No close way. Give me one more guest\n\nspk_1 : flavor. You were closely slavery,\n\nspk_0 : slavery. I was going to say for okay, slavery, right?\n\nspk_2 : The quakers refused to publish it. That\n\nspk_0 : is out of character,\n\nspk_2 : and, well, they're against therefore slavery. Yes, i'm kidding. Unfortunately, benjamin, you kid on this\n\nspk_0 : thing, I tried once, then go well.\n\nspk_2 : Fortunately, benjamin knew a well known philadelphia publisher named benjamin franklin. So on august seventeen seventy thirty eight franklin published really for this yeah all slave keepers that keep the innocent in bondage apostates pretending to lay claim to the pure and holy christian religion of what congregation forever but especially in their ministers by whose example the filthy leprosy and apostasy is spread far and near it is a notorious sin for which many of the true friends of christ and his pierre truth called quakers has been for many years and are still concerned to write and bear testimony against as a\n\nspk_0 : practice shut up I mean\n\nspk_2 : and hurtful to religion and destructive to government beyond what words could\n\nspk_0 : say source or can\n\nspk_2 : be declared by men of angels and yet lived in by\n\nspk_0 : ministers, judges and magistrates in america this is is that I didn't know titles could be run on that's that's that's a first kaka benjamin franklin invent electricity but not an editor how do you let that happen? I mean that many titles\n\nspk_2 : that's like that's like a two page title\n\nspk_0 : that's the part that doesn't thesis he's like that it's even then needs to be cut down\n\nspk_2 : and I have to be a big book to fit all that on\n\nspk_0 : already here we go so it's a catchy title for sure I can't stop thinking how much it rolls off the tongue\n\nspk_2 : his his writing was a stream of consciousness time\n\nspk_0 : really is titles like that\n\nspk_2 : here's a passage slaves kept for their glory and pride to wait on them amongst their proud lazy dainty tyrannical gluttonous drunken des boche visitors the scum of the infernal pit a little worse than the same that comes off their sugar when it is boiling which is composed of greece dirt done another filthy nous as it may be limbs bows and excrement of the poor slaves and beasts and other matters it's shorter than the title short in the title\n\nspk_0 : okay so my guess is well first of all it's ah great second of all my guess is this is not going to go over too well with\n\nspk_2 : nowhere to go but I also think probably the truth based on what we know about food production that guys would lose their limbs and get put in with the sugar I bet that was true\n\nspk_0 : oh god\n\nspk_2 : so he had watch\n\nspk_1 : sugar are slave he had watched the sugar foundations in barbados yeah so he's talking about sugar arms huh I want sugar arms to come back\n\nspk_0 : well I mean yeah I like\n\nspk_1 : you just open up a thing of sugar and there's a finger in there\n\nspk_0 : I mean yeah well yeah sugar figures definitely sounds like it could be a candy yeah\n\nspk_2 : so apparently all that stuff would go into sugar according to him s o I believe it went out the quakers were worried some people think the book was church sanctioned so they three times published an official notice in the pensively because that saying they had nothing to do with it absolutely nothing to do with it nothing to do with that it's not\n\nspk_1 : our deal we have nothing to do with it okay\n\nspk_2 : benjamin repeatedly said his enemies were elders in the church and that it was quote time for such old rusty candlesticks to be moved out of their places ok alright this's a time of there's a lot of generation divide amongst the quakers benjamin realized that the younger generation of activists were the best hope and made sure to distribute the book to them okay so six weeks after the book was published benjamin made his greatest protest of all time he hollowed out a book and he put an animal bladder filled with bright red polka berry juice inside okay and he walked thirty miles to burlington new jersey uh only eating almonds and peaches she's just got to know what that part was that's what he did he was there to attend the philadelphia yearly meeting the biggest quicker\n\nspk_1 : event of the year ok\n\nspk_2 : on our large coat benjamin's with clay keys the quaking spread neurological bedrooms wearing a military uniform and carrying a sword okay since the quakers had sworn off war this was quite a statement in the meeting he waited for the perfect time and then he sit up made a long statement against slavery during any tossed off his coat and exposed his military uniform okay and then he kept speaking and then he plunged the sword into the book spraying slave owners seated around him with fake blood wow people with a shit\n\nspk_0 : yeah this is a bank see they thought it was really yeah yeah this is it banks this is a bank safe\n\nspk_2 : a few quakers picked him up and carried him out of the building he did\n\nspk_0 : like champions after the super bowl dio I not madden\n\nspk_2 : he didn't resist he felt like he had made his point\n\nspk_0 : yeah I think he might have\n\nspk_2 : come in this is a fucking\n\nspk_0 : quality put a sword through a book that shot blood everywhere\n\nspk_2 : this is a quality yeah the benjamins quaker neighbors an aborigine owned a young slave girl then he would often argue with them about slavery insisting the\n\nspk_1 : girl should be free okay they did not give two fucks so\n\nspk_2 : one day benjamin saw the couple's sick your six year old son playing so he invited the boy to his cave and entertained the boy all day\n\nspk_0 : so this is before people got the message out that you need to know a guy well before you go to his case right okay jimmy don't go into any man's kanye yeah. So that night\n\nspk_1 : he sees the boy's pants running around frantically in a panic\n\nspk_0 : probably looking for their boy\n\nspk_1 : when they haven't seen all right\n\nspk_2 : and he asked what was the matter and they said their son was missing oh boy and benjamin said the boy was\n\nspk_1 : safe in his cave house thing.\n\nspk_2 : And quote you may now conceive of the sorrow you inflict upon the parents of a negro girl you hold in slavery for she was thorn by them jesus bye ever's\n\nspk_1 : just serving so fucking kick their dicks\n\nspk_0 : yeah like that is\n\nspk_1 : a fucking not clearly that didn't go over well with the quakers but\n\nspk_0 : right but it is but that's a fucking sample some of making points yeah seriously benjamin had a\n\nspk_2 : lot of contempt for the quakers who supported slavery because they hope to buy slaves themselves one day wow which is the most grotesquely american thing i've ever wrapped\n\nspk_0 : yeah, right yeah, a american dream\n\nspk_1 : the american dream to own a slave so you don't want slavery to go away because\n\nspk_0 : I might no one someday so don't even you're not going so you're a plumber right? This country great history of ethnic capitalism yeah, yeah\n\nspk_2 : somehow through all this benjamin kept attending church services okay in march seventeen forty to benjamin inside to protest the mistreatment of people who harvested tea and asia along with the americas in the americas who produced sugar to sweeten the team set up a table at an open air philadelphia market in place fine china teacups and saucers that had belonged to sarah on top the crowd gathered what's this hole about their thinking\n\nspk_0 : about what's going on.

Benji the benjamin lay facebook group yeah,\n\nspk_2 : the benjamin lay society\n\nspk_0 : delay heads\n\nspk_2 : so the lads so go the benjamin lay society on facebook that's what she did in philadelphia and get get that fucking pen shit out of there because this guy was the real deal,\n\nspk_0 : I think, is your gun?\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, I was going to see your friend, the painting,\n\nspk_0 : that it definitely is such a good story, because let's, have a look at this. Oh, wow. Well, that looks very surrealist. Good pain yeah it is it's interesting that's how he looks he certainly looks wizardly he does yeah that's it just it just it really does speak to the history of this country has and when there is bullshit the disenfranchised or the like people who are viewed as lesser have less of a voice but if you can be a fly in the ointment in anyway and disrupt and cause shit it might take a while but that is what we need more than ever right now because it is like I mean it is getting so ridiculous we're thinking that the elite you know our government and the elite people in this country in this world have any clue or any interest in what is best for us or best for civilization I mean as you sit here and watch like the world burn the record temperatures it is just like home oh sorry you haven't heard about that i'll do a dollop on that but you it is like that you just need to be pissed and use your voice when you're pissed yes oh and it goes beyond tweeting at people and goes toe like actually doing shit like saying should try to change people's opinions trying to like get people to do shit that is annoying it annoys them when you call them it annoys them when you write directly to them that annoys what other than just throwing your thoughts down and you know not a\n\nspk_2 : bed relay. I do\n\nspk_1 : and say about separating parents from the children of the border or the organization.\n\nspk_2 : Ice. We'll do a dollop on ice because you guys would be delighted to hear that in just a few years they completely changed\n\nspk_1 : from their original organization of what they were but they used to be water but now there are people out there and you can find them ball shiites ice sites all over the country and they are there at the they're at the ice officers they're blocking them they're stopping them from trying to stop people from going in and getting out they need food they need water, they need bodies they need supplies and that needs to happen now and think\n\nspk_0 : even about when you know like a couple weeks ago trump completely misspoke and he actually he meant to say wouldn't instead of would you think about that but before we had our I guess we'll call it apology for the misstep people are starting to show up outside of the white house more and more people every night were starting to show up and that bothers them that is born that is different than anything else\n\nspk_1 : we should like I don't think protests protest don't mean anything but I think surrounding buildings means something and I think and by the way let me just say this there's a fucking resistance group in in northridge, california I think they're called indivisible or whatever. Fuck you, you fucking idiots. We knew where jeff sessions was going to be in los angeles way had the fucking building about inside information, we're going to fucking lock him into a fucking building los angeles and those stupid, goddamn pragmatics pragmatists, assholes let the fucking word out, and he didn't go to the building. We were gonna have that fucker locked in, and they were going to fucking break through and drag his ass out by taking us down and those stupid fucking assholes pragmatist\n\nspk_0 : bullshit don't like jeff sessions have\n\nspk_1 : fucked. Yes, you do, that's. When you do it, you do it now, so that kind of shit needs to stop. Those motherfuckers need to get out of the fucking way,\n\nspk_0 : postponing it makes it\n\nspk_1 : harder, so fuck you, northridge, indivisible, you fucking week, assholes! Well, anyway, that's how I feel about\n\nspk_0 : dollar podcast dot com if you want to hear some of this fervor, live. Yeah, but i'll be doing.\n\nspk_2 : I'll be doing just saying, i'll be doing\n\nspk_1 : people. Last there will be there will be adult on ice. Ice is a very, very, very bad thing, and historically, if you look at countries that have fallen into nightmare situations, forces like ice are the thing that lead to it anyway.\n\nspk_0 : It's an exciting time, yeah, six, all right, a couple cars this weekend will continue to do so.

Yeah, I, dave anthony reach story from american history to his friend gareth reynolds, who has no idea what the topic is going to be about. Friday. Uh huh. And proud and shut up july eighteen sixty six. Tennessee least convicts for the first time, the first german actors that's what we call a pas gang. What happened? What happened? Yeah, what least convict nunu, no, not that, ah, they would pay for the inmates housing in exchange for labor, so they put the convicts up and then in exchange for that, they would work all day. What a concept. The civil war was over. And tennessee. What was it? To take a pause, civil or take a pause. Tennessee was one of the mothers, many southern states struggling to find revenue after the whole owning people. Think it's, the it's like the coal mining phase now where you're like, well, what's, next, yeah, don't don't bring up the coal mines right now. How many guys are coal miners? Right. Are you no, he's? Not how many of you are lying coalminers? New railroads are opening up in the states cold mining operations, creating a big demand for cheap labor. Okay, and you're in nineteen, seventy one miners and tracy city. Okay, no, you know, no one, because you could hear a chair moving here to chair, move heard us chair. Jeno wants from you. I think a lot of these towns no longer exists, but we'll see they struck for higher pay and ending the script system, okay. Tell us about the script system. It's, who puts on the spelling bee. Correct. Ah, so companies started using convicts. Is coal miners convicts? Why don't you tell some of the people out there who don't know what it is, what it is? We'll get to it, okay, convicts released for a one hundred thousand dollars per year to tennessee coal, iron and railway companies. So you get you get as many as you want for a hundred grand. What not okay, I thought, each no, no, no, no, this is on, you know, you get a hundred grand. I get the whole shim dango homeboy hole, while I do both flip, flo stopped. So the company was working sixty percent of all prisoners in tennessee. Okay, andi, even sub leasing convicts to smaller minds. What substance? Yes, you get it. You could sub let it, guy. So you get a guy, listen to what you just answer the question, you get a guy guy, so you get a guy like I get too many guys and you go over to a little calm. I just found out i'm going to italy for the summer. Yeah, you'd be like, hey, you want a guy and that i'm gonna be like, I totally want a guy. I think there you go, just feed him or whatever. God damn it! The company said it was leasing convicts to counter the quote, high cost of regular minors. Yeah, okay, yeah, these ones were free. Jesus, give me right, i'm already a little worried, gets worse. I'm app that's what i'm worried, that's. Why I didn't say i'm upset, i'm worried, gets a lot, we're worried, yeah, but I mean, the writing is all over the wall, it's going to be terrible. Stop saying stuff like that, I need support. I don't need this, no support here, i'm gonna crush you in front of you doing this. Take your heart this question on the floor, like how grapes are made in the wind. The company vice president called convict labour quote on effective club to hold over the heads of free laborers. Wow. Just went out and said it not he felt no shame when he said that he just said yeah, for some years after we began the convict labor system, we found that we were right and calculating that free labors would be loath to enter strikes. Uh huh. You know, turns out turns out people in prison who are forced teo work in coal mines. Don't go on strike. Yeah, interesting how that works. It's. Weird. Yeah. It's weird. They put the convicts in the most productive areas and the paid miners in the areas of the mind that would take a long time to get cold out. So, you know, the shittier parts. Okay. Oh, because the coal miners were paid by weight, right? Not by the hour or whatever, which I think we should go back to it's a loophole within a loophole. Yeah, nice says they're great. S o they got cold script, which I brought up it's company money, so you could exchange it in the company store, but nowhere else I could take it. Tio frank, right at his stormy like, hey, frank and I was like, eight or eight, yeah, I don't like theme park bucks, it's like, yeah, it's like theme park box. You can only take six flagstone now, it's like chuck e cheese's money, it's not well, that's, not really my place, the blue one thousand dollars. You can get a bunch of stuff, great key chains. I mostly go there for the bronchitis. Hey, kids, get in that ball pit, get bronchitis, huh? Put him in your mouth. There you go, come to check each eas. We never wiped on our machines now with measles. S o, the miners had no choice but to use the stores owned and operated by the company. On that allowed the company charge higher prices for goods. He's getting a sweet debt circles where are you going to work for the company? Because you're already in debt. It's cool, s so this is actually illegal in tennessee at the time, but they did, and they did it anyway, so weird how that happens. That doesn't happen anymore. No, no, no, no, everyone follows the law, you know, you know, in america honor system. It turns out most of the prison population where african americans had a feeling this was going to be headed in this direction. You know, I know this is a shock for a lot of people in the audience, but, yeah, it seems like there's a problem with that. They were called zebras or stripers because of their black and white striped clothing. Don't go where you were going. Don't go to that ship, take it, take it back a little bit. For once, someone actually just call them because of their clothes, not something else, which I mean, yeah, which to me is, you know, always what I picture. I don't know what we want orange. I don't want to give notes on the wardrobe, but well, are just easier to see when they run away. Stripes, you could, you could hide behind aah! Syrian lay sideways way. Find a writer but no one sees you. Where the hell is a? I think he's a white picket fence. It was the black stripes going across part of it. That's. The phase gone. Uh, prisons were overcrowded, had poor food, poor sanitation. There was violence, and convicts were overworked. So that's different. Yeah. That's. The change. I know for sure this. I'm sure we'll get resolution at the end of this one. So the comics were were put into stockades. In mining towns. They built a little stockade and that's where they put the convicts in. Okay, they were so crap the space prisoner slept in was a quote, good sized grave. What a horrible way of defining it if they got nice pacey grave. Yeah, I mean it's. Not like it's. Great. We could spread out a little. You roll around in nice grave. Yeah, right, tonto. But some people would kill for a nice grave. Yeah, some people are killed and in nice graves. And the medical facilities were to revolt. Er, revolting for popular reading for what? Popular reading for popular reading for unpopular reading. Super good, super good, popular reading. Yeah, like, sure, good. Thank you. No, the tennessee commissioner. Labor reported that prisoners had an appalling death rate. Hoping there'd be a little more to that, like some sort of like path to solving it. But no, no, they just said, they just die, right? So Coal Creek War came one of tennessee's, most lucrative coal mining areas and the largest town in anderson county. The anderson is here tonight is so crazy that there's one person. Is it really only one person here from anderson county, two or she's superfast three? Yeah, over there now, yeah, hi, are you coal miner? No who's, your family, coalminers, all right, it's disappointing. There were three thousand people living there by the eighteen seventies that's fucking huge right okay right a man in a eighteen nineties and labor friendly politicians were elected including governor john buchanan ah and this made the miners fired up so they started making demands one was cash payments a set of scripts right yeah another was to use their own check wayman toe wake whole instead of the one hired by the company okay well so they're just kind of asking for some fair treatment that fuck you yeah we're going to break the company's what they're asking s o a nearby bryce ville they rejected the demands on april first shutdown operations okay two months later the company demanded the miners signing no union activity contract before they came to work and the miners refused and officially went on strike and then the company brought in the convicts ok forty white convicts arrive and started building a stockade the the striking miners demanded the convicts be removed and then the company tore down the miners houses to build the stockade so he's this well yeah they they were like get him out of here and there like what do we fucking turd on your shit? What that's not how this works is a different game you're over negotiating what are you doing so that minors and local merchants got together to figure out a plan the next day in the early morning over three hundred miners and citizens of a cold creek holding miners, lamps and axes and things of that nature. Well, I mean, that's got a little more intimidating. It's. Not just light based any longer. That's to shine on thee acts when it goes into heads. They overran the convict camp, took over the stockade and took the convicts to a train and put them on it and sent them to knoxville. Okay, cia motherfuckers. Okay, interesting move. Ah, mr goodwin, who was a li si, which means he was a guy who leased the convicts to the cos he was the middleman guy. We're going to the fridge door. Lee used to be previously known as a slave owner. Really shocking to hear that connection, thie job sound wholly different. Anyway, mr goodwood said, the miners demanded that he released the convicts, and he responded over my dead body on and then and then he did it right, and then he was like, never mind let's, take him to the train. Yeah, so the compass you're put knoxville, they put in the county jail and the governor, or the commissioner of labour and mine inspector, to go with state militias and take the convicts back, how many, like the price ls? There weren't that many, and they were like, forty. They were just building stockade, okay, the governor said. The sheriff of anderson county asked for the state militia to be sent. Now the militia was known as the knoxville rifles. Okay, they're still called that now there an indoor football team now. Come on, rifles. Big day, there's. The playoffs. Right? So the knoxville right rivals apparently had a chip on the shoulder, I guess. And there was a last season. Weigh that and was not pass interference. They lost to the miami flamingos. Rough year. Yeah, well, that they could only play on one leg. So it's. Kind of unfair. Yeah. Quote. The boys say they will show the people who have ridiculed them, that they're made of this stuff that stands fire, although they would like to go forth for a better costs. Wait. That's, on behalf of who? That's the knoxville rifles. They're saying that they're going to go forth and show people they could do the job. But they'd rather not do this one. That's, right, big ambivalent since eighteen o two. The knoxville rifles did not have any supplies for any sort of extended situation. Okay, problematic that's, not good. Governor began and plan to go to the miners and talk to them and delighting the convicts. Go backto work. Eugene merrill, who is the leader of the miners ah called, have a secret meeting. There are about five hundred there. Ah, it's, kind of a big secret. Yeah, well, it's up in the hill, so, you know, what's it like you got hills over there, right? Yeah, this is going to gorge or whatever. It sounds like you're making parts of this up, if not all of it. You know, I think overto todo over the table, like you've gotta hills, a lot of hills. Okay, sure, uh, philologist. So all the towns of this point were scattered about five miles apart. All the mining towns ok on dh there, thinking they're going ahead to the next mining town and stir shit up knoxville journal quote. Editorial. Naturally, the sympathies of the journal or with the miners, but they have violated the law of the state and society will demand that the law be vindicated. God, they may kill some of the guards and militia. They may destroy property, they may liberate some convicts, but in the end, the law will prove strong and will prevail. What did they even arguing for? I don't know what, like it's, a bad editorial look, they might kill a bunch of guys and just fucking burn shit up and fucking let all the prisoners on what the editorial part of this wins. In what capacity? What long! An editorial by jim confusing. For years, the republicans had fought against convict leasing. But organized labor was, quote, voting for democratic candidates for the legislature, blinded to their own best interest and held captive by democratic leaders by ropes of baseless prejudice. And anyone want to move a chair. The people of anderson county were on the side of the miners. The average pay of a paid minor was two dollars per day. Jesus on those wages, obviously help on all the farmers and merchants and towns. When they brought in convict labor, there is no money for local businesses. The convicts were fed by huge food, shipped it on train, so it was just everybody got fucked. The next morning, the train arrived, a large crowd watched, the convicts were marched to the stockade. No trouble, everything's fine. The governor arrived in another train. He said law and order must not be overthrown, and that he was sad that this is have had happened. Sure, yeah, well, and he's, obviously, clearly ground flooring this problem by getting on a different train. It speaks to how much he cares about that everything's fine i'll take this big one actually they'll do theirs quote it is not the way to correct an evil to try to overthrow the law well actually there's a whole stew poke what if the law's not good well then you just gotta live under okay just then that's the only time no band before me were no man before me would have any respect for me if you did not see the law's executed I don't make the laws they have been made by the man whom you sent to the legislature every two years they went on for a long time talking about law blah bitty blah no one gave a shit it was quiet staring at him and they were bored and then their leader eugene merrill stood up the minor spokesman he gave a speech that was just constantly interrupted by cheers and applause the governor has said the laws against us why is the loss a rigidly enforced when towards the operator's it is not in the first place script is paid to local cold diggers for use at the company stores at a discount of twenty percent again cars later with coals in the mine are weighed in the dark and they mount put on a weighing sheet and fixed up while the miners are a mile away. That seems like a fucked up system yeah and a fair point so that with a lot of applause break. You got because i'm not like you go, not like you guys who did not seem fired up through goes, no, no, no it's, a different time. But still, I mean, that was like that that's like the miracle speech, that's, just like, I guess you guys don't know the fucking miracle speech, okay? Yes, I d'oh. It's, stand up! Do it now, now, now! D'oh! I bet you if we played those russians, they beat us nine out of ten times. But not tonight. Tonight we went. Oh, my god! Where? Where is that guy supposed to be? From it's? From lee's like a weird midwest. I'm doing kurt. Kurt russell. Just keep reading the goddamn story. Oh, he's from kurt russell. He's rumored. Please come from russell vania, if you must know, he is curd of russell vania that's fair. Not tonight. So that means i'm sick and tired of hearing what a great hockey team. The russkies half. All right, now go. So the meeting broke up. No trouble. It might have been also because the guards were posted all over the place looking through their gun sights that the miners she's kind of making up. Sit down. Start. Shit. Where was the miners going? Toe we're going to meet later in trouble was expected because their wives and children were at this point nearly starving. Oh, my god! Uh, men died. One hundred men stormed the knoxville company minds armed with rifles and shotguns. The guards moved one hundred twenty five convicts at the mine into the mine and then barricaded them inside. What a weird decision. Put him in the mind that'll make him happy. That won't upset him further. When you're down, there is a mining right two birds, one cole. So they got all the convicts stuffed in the minds, and then the miners. When they ran past the stockade, they shot in the air, and the the guards got scared. What, what, what what were the guards expecting to have happened? They were shooting, we were so nervous, well, boy, clark peed his pants. I did so scared, I didn't know they'd be shooting. I told you explicitly, there might be shooting. I heard lamps, but you're scared of labs. I just heard they come with lamp. We're all scared of lamp, sir. Governor buchanan came on and joined the militia, and he held the rifle for a bit to make a little bit of a show. Look at mei. I'm one of you. I've got this in my hands. I, uh, just one of you. All right, take it. I'm leaving away. So he left there's, a hair in my hand, milk. They've had quite a day in the man's world. Who I feel like, you know, I may be judgmental right here. But I feel like no one in tennessee has ever had hand of milk. It's. A cz common, is when they fan themselves and go, oh, my! Pick up a book for god's sake. The journal so apparently the militiaman were at this point getting exhausted by the whole thing in the journal wrote that if relief did not come for the soldiers they were going to just leave and go home interesting tactic it's rare they were not being treated well they were getting just two meals a day and the food was dirty and unfit to eat that's like no meals a day yeah well they were just probably getting fed the convict food right so they what interesting so now they're like we're actually we've picked a side now can we go on strike what now we're I know you're to stop the strike but we're going down the mine hires of guards know what the knoxville rifle riflemen were also wearing heavy shoes that had come from the convicts clothing supply because their own shoes had worn out i'm constantly being on guard one soldier was seen barefooted interesting looking any fun you know it's not great for ah war no yeah usually don't see guys without shoes on you know not john mcclane ng through a battlefield yeah shoot the glass the sheriff then said he had never asked the governor to send militia in the first place and that and that the governor and asked he never responded and then the sheriff said since he didn't ask for the troops if they killed a minor they would be guilty of murder so then they're like what is going on yeah, and then he was accused of neglecting his duties. And so, at that point, he just left town. What, this year of took off chair of where you going? I'm out of here, fuck this shit. What? No, I was like, but there, this is bad, and you guys are really good. You should be offered and like, fuck you, you're all assholes, i'm going to hawaii. They might have found it by now. They found it a while ago. They did find it a while ago, that's what i've had it ally, which has been around for a while and established, not not it's, not a part of america, is that america. Yet everybody knows that territory. It's, a territory exactly, thank, but obviously, I know i'm the one moving there. It's been discovered, it's, a territorial who discovered it, jonathan, hawaii, and ah, and i'll tell you, and i'm excited to become a citizen. If that's, what is the deal there? It probably is, because you're not saying anything, so i'm pretty sure i'm headed for citizenship. I'm how unease. They're going to kill you. And plant pineapples in your skull. So that's, kind of what it's like there now, just a bunch of white dudes with pineapples and there's calls. It's, great, though especially quiet, may have already won the tickets on the goat. The plane will is around. We'll take that. We'll take that. No need for a but anyway. On what effort? There's, no plane, there's, no plane. I know i'm getting, but I have an idea about something called the plane and it's been. It's. One of these things. I keep thinking about what if a boat could be a bird and that's just where i'm at and i'll stop, and i'm headed there and take care, guys. Good love boat birds, one to grab the badge. Is the sheriff it's like a bouquet at a wedding? You're next. Those sheriff works and is here. And what do I know? I'm headed to a territory on a boat where i'll get a pineapple in my cranium. Ah, anyway, the sheriff's gone right finger back, back on track from the leaf. Chronicle quote. Sorry, leave chronicle, allow tio dio stories about trees on trees, about trees. The leave chronicle, quote, the treatment of the troops has been to disgrace to the town. Public and private citizens stand on the street corners and loudly, a vow that they hope the miners will exterminate the troops when they move into the hills. Okay, that's, kind of fucked up, that's, aggressive, but I mean that's, what you get in the leave chronicle, they don't pull punches. No, they don't know hard hitting. You, you read the leave chronicle. What what is that? Why you? Ed mcmahon ing a table? Oh, my god! And ed mcmahon reference. I met him once, shook his hand, put on your bengay west allis mall. The next day, fifteen hundred armed miners surrounded the cold creek stockade. Okay, that's a lot that's as like numbers. We're strong. Yeah, it's, a lot of the population of a town you were talking about his laces, I mean half a town, which is a lot. The soldiers agreed to leave and take the convicts with them. Rumor was new, troops were being sent. The miners weren't done, though they marched on and reached the knoxville iron cos minds in the afternoon, they told that order to get rid of the convicts. Orden said, okey doke. Alright, thanks for stopping by. Very intimidating group. And i'm not an idiot. So do your thing. One hundred seventeen convicts and fifteen guards were walk to the train depot, while fifteen hundred armed miners followed. Behind them was an awkward, awkward walking and knowing the people on the trainer like, cool, yeah, whatever you need, whatever we, khun d'oh, you still there? No, but the train s o they're waiting for the train, and then the miners invited that's, an awkward wait. Yeah, so what else? What, you guys up, we're pissed cool. What what's going on the line? I mean it's. Bullshit. Cool, no about but this is how I ask. Sorry. Go ahead about those titans. What in the in the future? I'm not good at talking. Yeah. Train's coming tune. Three hours. Oh, my god, what? We just missed the last one. You're the first you're the first person i've ever talked to. All right, well, terrible start. I want to see my stuff. Know what? So before the train came there, waiting around on the miners, decided to invite the militia guys to dinner. What? Well, there's, no reason that we can't eat together, break a little bread, right? Someone and the miners and the soldiers ended up getting along great as that's nice. Many of the troops belong to the same fraternal orders as the miners, just so they ate food. They had a good time, and as they left, one of the troops yelled, what's! The matter with the miners and the other troops, replied, quote, they air all right, so they're having a good time. Fucking just it's, just a different time with language. It's not fair to judge, but as faras just like around, I mean that's, just confusing from top to bottom. None of this matter, with the miners there. All right, so nothing is what they're saying. Better than not, they're good. Cade miners, what's their problem. We like them, all right, great care, boys chair. Outside thirty women offered this soldier's baskets of food and water is they left, so they're trying to fucking butter these guys up, right? Yeah, it's, also interesting that it was nice em paths showing up. Yeah, obviously, this didn't make the mine owners look great. Well, the miners seem reasonable. A mine honor d b jenkins came out to show why mine owners should never speak in public. Was it a rule? I'm excited. Was it a rule that if you had a lot of money and we're a dickhead, that you could only have initials for the first part of your name? Yeah, that's, just like the flag of an asal. One hundred percent have baby jack in fucking asshole! Yeah, it's, just the must. Yeah, rockefeller, j d. Real dickhead. I am. So d b said so this is devi. This is tv's moment to shine he said the mine owners have been notified that if they did not take an agreement that convict labourers will be brought in because stockholders and invested fifty thousand. So the mind had to be kept working when you pay him more when he said, when the miners heard the extortion like demand, they just laughed and told the company go for it. So the strike's all their fault. The whole thing is therefore right. And he went on to say that the minor's leader, eugene meryl, had once been employed by the mind but quote, on account of his dictatorial manner, I was compelled to seek other employment and went into the merchant business. Okay. In truth, merrill was a union organizer and had been fired for organizing. D b then said merrill was probably the very guy he himself had talked about in his speech about ripping off the miners in his store. That's a swing so he's saying that because merrill was a story, I was jacking up prices, right? Meryl was talking about himself when he talks did the speech about the bad store owners okay, I told you you shouldn't talk. And truth maryland ran a store. But instead of ripping off minors, he advanced them fifteen hundred of merchandise, hoping that when the strike ended, they would pay him back. So, good guy. Yeah, and the owner said the miners were paid in cash, not scripts, which is. But they also did have a company mind store. But that was just so the miners could feed their families. Which some companies did, is a script system. So he literally said they like doing that, except for there where we do it with them. We have tio it's sorry, his mind Coal Creek War a punch out system, which is like taking advance on a check, jenkins said. Toby still basically out yeah, it's called a payday loan. Yeah, jack it's said the miners were so to pray if they would advance against their pay to buy liquor each day instead of waiting for payday to get cash from the company, right, but that's fine. I mean, if I worked in a coal mine and I would just get shit faced all the time, absolutely in the in the coal mine, that's, a bad move, it's, a pretty safe driver down, was up. I should not be doing this right now. We're deep it's a super safe job, so you just get shit faced down there and, oh, it is because of my head. It seems super no coma there's, not one coal miners ever died on the job. It's. Just that I feel like on this podcast, okay, if you say so, I trust you, man, no it's there, like I was the only profession no one's died doing for all of them. Quote such men as maryland. His followers have no one to blame but themselves for the appearance of the convict labour at the mine. He's. Still going, yeah, he's a fucking is there anyone around him like, but he pulled up tp, let's, pull that plug, let's, let's! End this. So if you know, owners thought they're awesome. The governor, buchanan cam, and that with a different parties, the miners agreed to a sixty day truce if the governor promised to call a special session of the state legislature and recommend the convict lease law be repealed. Right, okay, fucking winning. Well, none other than hiatus. No, there. Get on, because it's, a half time calling in the state like what they do with cricket, they just like having a supper for a couple days, and then they'll play in a couple more. I had to call in the state legislature. Oh, yeah, right, have faith in them, right? Yeah, for sure. So the comic labors returned on july twenty six. Headline was all's well, and it appears it'll end that way. What, and what? The optimist weekly. What that is so vague and, by the way, headline will never see again, you know, sorry, gang that's. Yeah, that's not happening, is it? Oh, my god, I mean only in like a zine and like a little town that is underground. Hello, did you hear everything's? Good way we found a little water it's, a big week down here. I read it's all fucked weekly. They're also good, hard hitting politicians of both parties strongly denounced the convict lee system. Ok, I was coming out against it. They're all fucking on board. What is that like to see your government, like, unite over something that's, right? It's going crazy? Like for pressure to matter for people that, like, put pressure under for them to be like, well, we should respond. They've told us what we should dio instead of, like, don't answer questions unplugged. The phones hide under the desks. We'll wait this shit out. Oh, so a little bird friend whose animated is here find that sound like zone was calling their dog. But so now all the politicians are saying they're against the least system because all the people are obviously against it. The governor called a special session to consider convict leasing on august thirty first. Two big questions. Should they terminate the current convict leasing contract, which was which was set to expire in eight. Eighteen, ninety five. What year are we in now? It's? Eighteen, ninety one. Okay. And then? And then if that happened, what would they do with the convicts they got rid of that were in the system? Because they don't have any money to pay for him. Well, you could have created this great thing. Where there, let him go. Slaves. Yeah, yeah, exact could let him go. But then they may be out running around, and then how would you get stuff out of the minds? How would you get free work? Is the question stuff out of the mind's free work from its not free. Because I pay that what? You could be the guy who runs the prison. Ah, hundred grand. And then he doesn't have anybody to take care of it. He just sits around his house with money, and then all the people work there has nothing to do with so much has changed. It does sound like amazon, so the it was like twenty percent. The rest, her like. I love it. Very convenient. I am super against it. Yeah, I have prime but it's just what us bad it is disgusting what they do but once that blender gets here i'm only going toe hang around for a little while longer you know, it's just like these people who are part of the problem I actually ordered a book about it yeah, from amazon about how to sort of deal with the world now and change your life and that's why? You know, i'm getting a lot of really just a meditating mohr with this whole little area have created a door decorating with a bunch of stuff from amazon they have this whole thing with the then I work at amazon and alexa remember about my life about alexa michael lex has done I got rid of my wife because I could just talk to that little thing all of it. Yeah, well, no, they made an election with a hole now so you don't even I don't even need e I left my wife years ago since they made the fuck alexa the elects a five. Yeah, which is weird because I got rid of my wife alexa oh yeah it's amazing it's just like I want just having sex that i'm like i'm love again she's like mcdonald's nearby i'm like not now she loves mcdonalds alexa loves mcdonalds always so for some reason, days and days went by, and no legislation was passed. Weird how that works. On september tenth, things started heating up again. Twenty five are militiamen were sent to bryce ville to guard the east tennessee coal mining company, the militia man. We're supposed to get ten dollars, a week with rations, okay, there's, no in date for the assignment. When the militia arrived, the rich, rich mine owner goodwin inspected their guns on ly three worth carrying. Yeah, they came with not not working. Guns sort of takes the teeth out of a militia little bit it's, not great, it's, not great. Yeah, so what do we have? Props? We got a budget. Props. You got a rubber axe? Yeah, max, s o. He got them working gun. So you bought the mulligan. New guns, okay? Devi jenkins sent a letter to an attorney and cold creek asking him to quote, breakdown e irish and eugene meryl's character and make your own charges. But be sure to get away with it. I mean, it's, just it's. I like to call that incriminating. I don't know about everyone else just shined evil ass. Yeah, what, i'm not. I'm not give a fuck jenkins, davey, deliberately blatant, just turning my moustache. The attorney was unable to find anything on the union. Laters. The Coal Creek War eines decided this would be a great time to cut pay. Feels ill timed thejob. The wages of cart drivers from fifty cents a day to ten cents a does shit, which is just in eighty percent. Pay cut, that's all nothing big. Now this is going to sound shocking, but they went on strike across the district. If you could believe that what I want around sucking take your dime and be happy time you could be a convict now, it's. Easier to carry there's a plus that is a plus. After three exit debating the legislative legislature came up with a great solution. I'm sure they did. They made it a felony to interfere with the convict leasing system interesting and authorized the governor to take any action necessary to protect it. So that is a it's. So weird. Have you ever heard of this in america, where they say they're going to do something, they do something else, and then they make it illegal to get upset about it or do anything about it it's almost like they scream and scream and scream, and then, when they have a chance to change that, they don't do anything that's weird. Yep, be proud. God bless this mess. Fucking eagle should fly through here right now. That's. How also is travel with an eagle or a falcon of some kind? So then the legislature adjourned after passing that those awesome things. Strangely, the politicians that been talking out of their ass is when they made their speeches, and now they have made things worse. The politicians, they read that back, make sure he's bred the right group the politicians have been talking about. It was them, same at the mine. The miners have won one final hope. They're all to the pin, their hopes on the court system, the state tennessee state court system, yes, but you guys all love, I can tell, very progressive from what i'm hearing. There was a case in the courts claiming the poor conditions inmates worked in and lived in, violated state law. It was like a slam dunk, dave. Yeah, and it's, incidentally, wasn't around back then. Yeah, there was no slam dunk that came in the nineteen eighties. There is some time. When that happened, it was like the hi fi. Oh, yeah, we did. It was like, if people like, what the hell the fuck, you can't do that. So the case have been brought by a mine inspector george ford, and one of the mine owners, d b jenkins said ford knew nothing about mines, and if he was given a map of minds, he would understand them about as much as a shoemaker would, and therefore it was incompetent for him to make any report on mines are mining is lamb with that? If you looked it, maps of the minds, you wouldn't know anything more than a shoemaker. What? Well, if you showed a mind map to a shoemaker, the shoemaker would be like, yeah, it goes down and then over there, I know exactly what kind of shoes you'll need to get down there. No, you don't understand the premise of what i'm trying to do here, sir. But he was saying this about a mine inspector who needs to know everything about minds, right? Yes, it is a huge slam. Sure, the case move quickly and reach the tennessee state supreme court in october of eighteen. Ninety one. Okay. Yes. Is it a yes ruling was against the miners, of course. Deciding the sanctity of contracts. You can never break the sanctity of a contract. That was the minors. Last hope for salvation for a living. A decent life for hope that the wives and children would not starve. Reaction is pretty quick. On october thirty first, the tennessee coal mining companies stockade was burned to the ground and one hundred fifty convicts were set free. Okay. No, no, no. We like convicts getting free. Do it! No! Ah, quote. A terrible explosion occurred close to the stockade that fairly shook the mountains round about. The explosion was followed by rifle firing. And many of the citizens of bryce ville immediately took to the nearest station with the hopes of making a freight train. Then d'oh, then dio. Yeah, it's. Just a way of saying there's a train coming, okay. Locals gave the convicts clothing and told them to run for it. Okay, it's. Good. The convicts were seen running towards Coal Creek War their clothes as they went. What size shoe are you? Let me measure your inseam and lets you know it offhand. Thank god for these taylor's being in the trenches over here. Take this. You'll look great. Don't forget your curcio goodbye. A chain conductor said most of the convicts seemed to be running towards kentucky, so they were like that way, okay. Meanwhile, the guards and miners were shooting at each other, the assistant of prisons said what he left, the stockade had been burned, and he saw sheets of flame and heard shooting. Then he went to his home on bell street for the evening, what he was like. Well, it's, five o'clock that's, the end of that there's, no stockade anymore. Now that you're here, you got to get out of here. Good night, there. Well, how is work fun, whatever usual stuff, starkie there, staring at a bunch of paperwork. In the morning, everybody ran a bill from my hands. Yes, prepare my hand, milk, that's a thing. Obviously, we dio here at everyone. Lastly, with tennessee, thank you. A witness said the woods were full of people in convicts fleeing in terror while the shooting continued around the stockade, quote fires were started on the hilltops, which were undoubtedly intended to some in the minors in surrounding areas. The witness arrived here, scantily clad, barefooted and with no hat thief. You could go somewhere barefoot, scantily clad. But if you're not wearing a hat, you better get a fucking hat on. What are you doing? Oh, my worst than a murderer, sir. You had this monster. Where is your half?\n\nspk_0 : Get my gun,\n\nspk_1 : betty, we gotta have this man out here. I'll break into the emergency hat drawer. We've got a lot of options, sir. Put a hat on or get away from my wife. It's. Okay, he's got a head on. Now! Come out, everybody! Sorry, you had to see that son. What was underneath there? It is a god damn it. Do we have some kind of memory wipe for the boy? I have another hat. You've got ptsd now. It's! All right, everyone put on hat. So let's. Gather in the living room. My god! Headline the next morning. Quote. Man doesn't have a hat. It's. Anarchy in the hills, its head, anarchy. What has become of america? We're not a hat list land. Headline the next morning. Quote. Peaceful, quiet has come after the storm. Was this the leaf chronicle again, that just garbage headlines. What? Just tell me, what's going on that looks like it's, a weather forecast. If it's in the paper like it's gonna be a balmy weekend, don't worry, honey, the sun's coming out, it says, the towering chimneys and small during pieces of timber lying on the ground where the only remnants of what had been what had once been the headquarters of nearly two hundred zebras and at one time, the lamented home of the tennessee militia, yeah, locals were seen sifting through the ruins, looking for mementos. You're going to say, mentos, it is different, yeah, it's, peppermint studio, searching through it. Oh, that was a tooth, the fresh makeup at the end, that was a to the fresh bacon. Captain chumley's. Story been attacked. Captain chumley's store had been. Is this the game of clue? He was an agent of the knoxville iron company, and he lost around two thousand five hundred worth of goods shoes with the most stolen item. It's, it's, all the guys running, for sure on hats for sure, you don't want production, also the stars, the store itself was pretty smashed up. The whole area looked bizarre, quote, one of the most peculiar sites ever. Scene is that of zebra clothing scattered on both sides of the rail road all the way from Coal Creek War, hard to explain to your kids, you know that. Oh, well, that's, just convicts got naked. What did we find? They got on the train fied with a fucking danny. Is there a comment there? Well, i'm scared. What? Not sure if it calm has even been invented. Yet no one has semi colon is down the pipe. Whoever invented that cherica. People in towns like clinton, oh, yeah, it's, still there. Are you from clinton? Fuck, yeah, I told you, I knew we'd get to you at some point. Clinton's, air big here, clinton's were now. Now, it's, not here Denver big. Turns out they're not big anywhere. Huh? The worst food. Almost there's there's. Actually, someone worse. That turns out, uh people in towns like clinton were now worried about a flood of convicts pouring in, quote, every available firearm of whatever size is out, and citizens are patrolling the town to prevent an influx of convicts. Man, oh man, yeah, one convict, richard humor telegraph the governor, and said they'd all been released and they didn't know what to do, he telling craft. The governor governor was like what? I think they wanna hang out governors, like, well, fucking run for it, like, what do you insane, we're coming to get you go. Hi, what have you ever done this before? Don't message me looks weird. Eventually, most of the four hundred fifty eight convicts released were rounded up and put in overcrowded jails in knoxville and Nashville. Been listening a lot or what's the deal. Denver convicts were sleeping on any floor space available. It was so packed, a prison official predicted the convicts would be dying like sheep within less than a week. What was up with sheep? I know I was going to say they're dying wrap, but they just keep dying. When I put him in my house, I pack them and they die packing, man, they die. Every time I put sheep in my house, they die. So, are you going to fall asleep if I accountant? Which gave me an idea. Yeah. There was discussion of bringing up assistant commissioner of labor and minds allman on charges of treason. The lead chronicle, the leaf chronicle here, we g o said the punishment will be death by hanging, several soldiers claimed. Alleman said he would resign his office and take up his gun to aid the minors. He was also said to have met with the miners and incited them to attack. Ok, pichon fucking government bastard! Sure. Anyway, he didn't die. He didn't die. But when I read that in the paper, I was like, this would be cool. And then nothing. A second truce was negotiated. The miners agreed to allow the convicts to return to cold creek and oliver springs, but not bryce ville. Okay, the state argued, by the way, when I was looking upset about bryce, fill the post office close in two thousand. So price feels. The state argued with the prison system about who would pay for capturing the convicts and for guarding them. When they went back to the mines, calling out the militia. It cost one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, which is more than the least system saved. And the stockades had to be rebuilt. So it's, almost it's, almost like attacking property when fighting oppression in a capitalist system, is effective anyway. That's a troubling conclusion, anyway. Excuse me, anyhoo, what do you mean, anyhoo, any whose, what i'm just saying, if you attack property, it cost in money, and then then then they might stop doing it. Let's. Keep going, allegedly allegedly s o eighty four militiamen were sent to Coal Creek War oliver springs under the command of j keller, anderson, j killer and heller different. Far different. Hello, my name is jay killer. Oh, god, i'm j. When the train arrived at Coal Creek War station, two hundred men and boys stood around watching the train moved up to the stockade, and the men and boys followed. They're all looking at a gatling gun the soldiers had brought with them. Jesus, it seems pretty mean serious. You boys want to look at it, pull that trigger a little, huh? The troops marched in single file to the us to k the stockade. Anderson then went about building what he then named fort anderson, interesting amigo upon militia hill, the gatling gun, his idea. Okay, well, then he deserved credit. They raised the us flag and the troops tree here. They raised the us flag, and the troops cheered, and then a minor yelled, quote, it won't stay there long. We'll shoot it down and you with it and then and then all the miners cheered. Oh, boy, I don't know how I feel about a flag off. On november sixteen, the local paper wrote, a visitor would hardly know there have been so much trouble the miners were almost at work full time. They seem cheerful, having won a battle, getting the convicts at a price, phil, they did not seem to fear any consequences. There were no rumors of coming trouble. Sounds like that headline was right. Oh, david, david, david, actually, that wasn't going to work for the mine owners. Weird. On december twenty second, three days before christmas, the tennessee coal, iron and robot company issued an order for two hundred convicts to be sent to bryce ville, the one town they had all agreed upon. The company would not send convicts to. They were blowing up the deal with a big. Nice those goddamn unions, right? Yeah, no, i'm sure this is going to go over fine. Surely we're nothing eventful. The convicts return to bryce phil on january thirty, must just felt good to. They were probably cited a lack of love and how they love us over there, high on away game forever. When they arrived, soldiers posed for a photograph, what with their gum guns, aimed at, quote, on escaping black convict like you're making, they're faking, they're thinking like he was escaping, and their aim, their guns on him, like, was like a job for him to play there. Yeah, fun park for his photo. I think we got it. Let's, do two more. One goofy faces, guilty face dio I do that one. Then one of the soldiers accidentally fired his gun, killing the convict. Now. But what a picture. What a photo! She's. I know it's, horrible, and someone had to die. But what a goddamn photograph! Get yourself a pulitzer for that that's crazy, anyway, that's hard that's our letter to write, though, is that what it was like? I don't know, I don't like this photo thing. We're doing crazy, let's, not do this where's my head, don't worry, the safety's off. Occasionally, miners would sneak into the hills and shoot it for it. Anderson soldiers within fire, back with the gatling gun jesus. So they're like, we're not goingto shoot down there anymore. They have a big, big, big, real, big, crazy gun. Some soldiers on leave just deserted, so they would. They would get sent on leave, and they would just take off that cell fan permanent. Leave nothing better. If soldiers left the fort, people would shoot at them in the town jesus. To amuse themselves. The soldiers started packing oyster cans with mud and firing it into the town below. I mean, that is quite a prank, though, when you're like more free oyster, more madam. But those oysters, they're not agreeing with me there. Way to those sky tens, man. Yeah, riel, buddy oysters, to the contrary, couldn't even find the oyster. Ah, who I am, mud up. So i'm looking for oyster. Can I moved? Keep doing a little funny thing. I'm out. I don't know if you heard the fizzle, but, ah, we peaked three quarters of the way through dave, so i'm going to need you to start getting back on track. Oyster can imagine a lot. By early august the miners were saying remove the soldiers or quote there is going to be big trouble okay so that's pretty got great I mean in the mining town of tracy city the company recently reduced coal output so they cut the paid miners hours in half okay but kept the convict hours the same you know why I my guess is because one of them was technically slavery yes I had a feeling that's great the prison stockade was burned and this convicts were driven out okay tracy city guard sped off to a convict camp in a nearby town of inman but they didn't get there in time the governor received a telegram from the warden at inman quote the convicts have been released by a mob of two hundred men are and are awaiting transit at the train station what is the reward for the leaders and men in the mob so he's already looking for cash I was like how can I make money out of this that's his first response a witness that inman said the guards could have easily held off the mob but the miners armed with axes demolished this arcades they also had lanterns so it was super obvious what they were going to dio could see everything super clear to see one side of a wall is cut down roof was crushed, interiors were destroyed officials were also very suspicious about the timing of a meeting that it happened a committee of miners from Coal Creek War giving resolutions to the governor at the exact time the stockade was attacked so I mean that's just analogue by counsel yeah eugene merrill was like I don't have anything to do with that shit down there the resolutions promised good behavior if the state troops were taken out except right now right right now in the Nashville banner called the miners quote thieves robbers ruffians and outlaws how many papers were there my god eight hundred fuck it's like every dude was like i'm gonna make a paper I found a paper called the comet I mean fuck mohamed it's like you're not even trying at obviously superman worked there yeah yeah the comet and what do you wear space knows nose from space everyone makes a paper for themselves on august sixteenth one hundred miners surrounded fort anderson for a leader yelled quote close up boys sorry close up boys let's take him close up close up our close up close up close up close up close up because that's that boy's not close up didn't go close up he was like close that boy's his guys I wasn't born more photo shoots which i'm like out for let's do the close ups oh you're talking about a whole different close up yeah I would think they'd be saying close up like get him quick close the fort yeah no he's saying everyone get close up close up okay sure, whatever. There's a good talk. It wasn't. No people were it's, a gripping, tense moment in the broadcast. Yeah, we're gonna put that shirt called close up and then on the back, it'll say, reads the same. Close up that's, what it'll say on the back. Hard to tell which side of the argument i'm on. Close up has that close up. And if I said, close up, boys, let's, take him, god damn them, some of the four year old back, come on and get us, you began, wow, and then the shooting started. It went on for a half an hour. A thousand rounds were exchanged. Just america used to be so fucking crazy. The next day, miners attack the prison stockade at oliver springs. They were beaten back by the guards, a much larger group of miners than arrived in support, and the guards surrendered. Okay, that stockade was burned in the comics, put on a train. Tch, private citizens in knoxville, raising our volunteer army to combat the miners. Businessmen with no experience dealing with this sort of situation joined up, hit him with my briefcase. How does this work? That's. When you tie the tie around your head, let's, do this. Come in. Oh, my god, wait till we get to the end. No, I don't know. Uh huh. My name's, roy, business class, sir. Come. I sell insurance, sir. What are we gonna do here? Thousand soldiers of volunteers headed for a cold creek on foot. They marched across mountains. But the night came and they found themselves deep in the forest. This socks in the morning they were ambushed by minors. Okay, so went really well. They had a nice hike and then lost. Two of them were killed. Jesus. The volunteers said there were somewhere between sixty five and five hundred miners. Do you have an onsite estimator? Is anyone here who here can is anybody a guest? A mater? Roughly. I'd say they're about five hundred. Okay. And that's for sure. Five hundred or sixty five. Okay. So that's, where we're sort of finding a problem area? Yeah. Personally. Okay. Would you say it was two hundred? No, unless i'd say less than one hundred thirty five less than two hundred. Did you say it's? Sixty five or five hundred it's between sixty five and five hundred. Just any number in between? Yeah. Yeah. You either saw sixty five people or five hundred people. Yeah, is between those two. I don't think you know the definition of between. Yeah, don't say, yeah, yeah, it was like five hundred five hundreds, like up to five hundred, up to five hundred, as in for ninety nine. No, no that's up to then it was fine. No, I mean, between sixty five and five hundred that's, not what between iss think so? Don't say, thinks, oh, no, so no think so. You don't think so, so I didn't go to school. How many figures, how many fingers am I holding up, uh, it's, between between seven and and for four? Yeah, between seven and four. Actually, twelve. What the fuck are you talking about? Between twelve. And for it is that I was just doing the math. Not twelve. Yeah, but you can hold up a couple extra ones. All right, all right. Okay. Anyway, i'm just saying we need help. There's a lot of guys. And there's only a thousand of us, no there's, no, they got us outnumbered. What are you talking? Is a thousand of us between sixty five and five hundred them, so they have us outnumbered. We're in a lot of shit here. It's, like vietnam. Stop what, no, that's, that's it. I'm off to hawaii, and i'm done. I'm high woody's, i'm out of here. I am taking a flying boat there right away, territory or not. Later, it was determined there were a total of six miners. Hey, man. So we just wanted to circle back with you real quick because I wanted to give you an update because I know you said that you saw, but but now what was it again you saw between sixty five queen, right between sixty five, five hundred that's, right? Well, i've got great news, what's that we did a head count. Yeah, yeah, I got it. You got it now that we figured out if it was sixty five, five hundred between as some idiot. Yea, well, that was a nice and you want to know, what's that out a little bit less. It was sex. Yeah, that's, that's. What I said, between sixty five and five hundred, between six to five on five hundred, is what you were sixty five and five hundred. You're a lot of numbers in there. There's sixty six, there's seventy six, there's eighty six. The sixes. Took a train to get here to get you. I have to go back to my job teaching. I had a happy life in hawaii, had opened a surf shop in the territory. And then I just saw this, and I wanted to come over here to make you. We grow, and here you are, still dumb as shit. Miners air huge, though. So six come look like five hundred. If they come at you, i'm out of here. I'm robert and believing the cover there, covered in coal, so they look like more guys. Conversation's been over for a while. The leader of the volunteers was so exhausted he had to be hauled back to the railroad on a farm wagon. So he had that guy it's, a fun ride, like I was bad at what he was doing. The fighting continue to fort anderson in morning attack. Soldier sl waterman was killed by a premature discharge of a cannon. Well, so i'm assuming he put that he was like, we're putting the ball in, and then that was like, coming, mate. I'm simply put it in, and then out it came, and since he was here, that was probably not good for him. You got hit by a cannonball, very insinuated language, a lot of the way through that. Private smith was sniped and killed shots echoed through the valley for days incoming soldiers were stuck on trains that we're backed up on the tracks everything was getting tense and nervous from the journal quote as the shouting of official orders went along the lines of guards a terrified member of the army you're a winchester rifle he had stolen from under his seat threw himself flat on his back in the aisle and pumped fifteen bullets into the roof of the train car today he is swaggering about his home lying about the way he drove away the miners wait s so wait what did he do so he's he dropped to his back and just started shooting the roof into the train roof right now and then and then he was like I got rid of him but probie didn't you know I mean I mean you'd have to go outside the train to prove something like that thank you um in another car would fell on the floor and a six year old volunteer yelled quote there blowing us up with dynamite and everyone jumped out of the train did you say a six year old sixty sixty six year olds are in the back car okay sure yeah i'm sure they're they're somehow okay so okay it's zero what is like giant might yeah it was just a log run and everyone did general kearns rolled in and took over Coal Creek War ce he ordered all volunteer citizens to return to their homes. The casualty among troops came to five killed and and fifteen wounded. Six miners were killed in the attack. They arrested any minor that you mean sixty five or five hundred. Between sixty five, five hundred miners were killed. Thank you. They arrested any minor they could find in place them first in boxcars, and then in the schoolhouse and then in the church, his soldiers arrest around five hundred miners. Martial law was declared. Some miners refused to surrender and were hunted down. Jesus soldiers were led as deep as one mile down into minds to capture them. Holy shit, that that's a fun movie. Oh, yeah, that someone should make that into a movie. That's, when your way into your lantern, what happened? What's already healing anyone get what? Oh, and the oh, I hope. It just makes for a better story. Yeah, I should. I didn't read that anybody did, but someone had to have, right, yeah, you doing a side podcast with this guy in this is your replacement. Hands off, my man, stop asking fucking questions, my job. How long's this been going on? Yeah. You see, they're sort of on my side in a weii that's. That said, not how you support someone. Love you, too, sir. I think he was. I think he was talking to me. And my new podcasting partner, burt. The burden. Dave, show ball up. What's, your new show called called the boil. Why I just come up with stupid names. That's. Why? S o, by the end of it all, twenty seven miners were killed. Bullets, a nice treacle cutter to the moment. Yeah, but, you know, I mean, we all know how this turns out for coal miners, they win. The nox for knoxville journal headline quote. Capturing miners is fun. Oh, my god! What? Too many papers, that's, the problem. Everyone's making a paper, I mean. But the back then papers were like, you would open it because you were like a liberal or a lefty, like you would start a paper to just get your side out there. Well, I mean, again, that's gone so far, but doesn't have him so far away from our echo chambers. Thank god you think. Go ahead. Yeah. Capturing miners is fun. Somehow, tables are turned during this campaign, armed miners easily submit and the state militia exhibit unusual game. Behind every boulder in the hills where the miners were fortified are piles of shells and cartridges. They're picked up and exhibited as relics of war. A citizen brought in a flag of truce yesterday morning, and in a few minutes, it was cut to peace, is for relics. So there was just love relics. And now it's, just people getting, ah, you know, some something for the kids to show and there's cool. Yeah. Officials realized the number of miners that it actually been fighting was vastly overestimated. Instead of up to twelve thousand minors involved in the Coal Creek War, it was less than a thousand and something I know they were getting the numbers from.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, yeah, I was\n\nspk_1 : watching the whole thing. Twelve thousand. It laced, at least between\n\nspk_0 : twelve thousand four. Had\n\nspk_1 : to be. Well, I should go. My work is done. I have a five hundred thirty meeting. Between then five, anyway, allah s o, they were actually probably around five hundred, that we're fighting. On august twenty eight, most of the soldiers had left the cold creek area most head to return to the regular jobs, where they would be fired. There were only about, oh, the irony. There are on ly, about three hundred, militia men left in the area. A knoxville journal editorial blamed the miners who supported them, quote, organized labor. What follies! Oh, my god! I would give anything for someone on fox news to say that anything. What follies! Union members what? Fies what crimes have been committed in thy name? Let it be understood once and for all that this constant preaching about mine owners and manufacturers being monopolise is untrue. Oh, my god. That it is not only unjust but dishonest and that all good men of all parties will unflinchingly fight against such demagogic claptrap. And we will. And we will have taken the first and longest step toward a correction of evils that is threatening to sap the ray life blood of this nation. What year was the period when it was that? It just it wasn't yet. But obviously, obviously the miners of the problem. Yeah. There, there you can, just like so you. So you get eighty percent pay cut, but be happy to have a job? Yeah, I mean, you can just but truly you can just see it today. I mean, it is just the same shit. The thing walking into the camera like guys, come on. The thing is you're on the right side, it's. I keep trying to make this point. Why can't one guy, I have all the money. Hey, well, you know what it would. It would be better, because at least then it would feel like we knew exactly where to direct everything. Instead, it's this weird buck shot where you just don't know where the fuck the look, because there's like nine hundred different fires that you have to put out, I would much rather just be like he lives up there. Let's, go, fuck it! Cut! Is\n\nspk_0 : that after. Support.\n\nspk_1 : So the overwhelming nature of now where you're like. I don't know what to do. Check twitter. Sir, gentlemen, I know some of your upset. I don't support cutting heads off. I think I think we should put them in blenders. Seriously. See some guy wheeling out a giant blender? Yeah, here we go. Where the cook brothers. Come on! And I mean again, it's, like, if you're gonna put the system on trial, get the vita mix on amazon, you could get it in like night, like it'll get there. Super fast, that's. How you get the blender to show the corporate heads I will take if i'm looking for a product, I will take a good thirty seconds looking for for some from somewhere else before I go to amazon. So i'm doing my part. Yeah, for sure, yeah. I don't know what that means. I think ann landers is here yet. The paper said the mine, the mine operators, were not making any money and hadn't been for some time. These good men kept miners employed when they were losing money, and the labors should thank them for it. Quote, before the employer can afford to pay good wages, he must himself be prosperous man it's called trickle down. They should be happy with three fifty four, fifty per day, they makes at the editorial, even though no one was paid more than two fifty. Oh my god, are you still a numbers guy like you need that stuff to prove a point, you could say whatever number and its fine, what oh, you're such a fact stickler. He will love what's accurate. It just is weird, whereas I like guest imation's. I'd like to have a little fun, huh? Make it. I've lost everyone. The mine owners agreed to pay the cost of the battle. Three hundred miners and others involved in the cold creek uprisings were indicted. Many fled the state. Eugene merrill fled before he could be charged or brought to trial. He had already declared bankruptcy, haven't never gotten back the money for letting the striking miners run up tabs at his store, almost all who went to trial, where acquitted or found guilty, and then on, lee find. But one organizer was sentenced to seven years, the press that he was, quote on outsider from chattanooga. Outsider chattanooga motherfuckers. You know, come up in this bitch. There's. A famous saying here, it's, get your chattanooga ass out of here! Aggressive. Ah, she was, quote, an outsider from chattanooga who had come to anderson county to spread his anarchist philosophy. He was released after two years. Eugene merrill was spotted in indiana, six months after the skirmishes were over. It was believed he was going to be arrested, but he escaped again. The tennessee legislature let the convict lease contracts expire in eighteen, ninety six, five years after the fighting started. Okay, well, we'll take it so that's. Good, so a bit of progress, it's, but we are, yes, it's, lower than they know the brushy mountain state penitentiary to purchase land and had convicts mind cold directly for the state. Wait, why are we? We could be making money off this ship. We were let's. Do it again, or in nineteen thirty six, a state senator named robert lindsey convinced the tennessee legislature to change the name of cold creek to lake city, hoping to make it a tourist destination. Go swimming that call you enjoy that. Welcome to lake city, rocky top. Well, they changed it to lake city for a while, and that didn't take it well, and then it didn't take, and now, it's, rocky top. Look, I tried to keep reading that article, but I started bringing in the guy. I was just saying how all the miners were rich, and I couldn't read it anymore because he literally said the miners were rich and he was calling himself a historian. And then I blew my brains out. It was god to enrich miners. What do you have? Clothes? The third balance time. Amazed. Seventeenth two sat. Two thousand thirteen tennessee declared an end to the eighteen. Ninety two Coal Creek War and the least wait! Sorry. Something i'm rubbing up against us, how i've been alive for a good part of this war, it turns out, yeah, I told you, this story took place between eighteen, seventy seven, two thousand thirteen. Yeah. You're good kid. Yeah, may seventeenth, two thousand thirteen. Well, it's in this. Tennessee declared an end to the eighteen, ninety two Coal Creek War, and a peace treaty was signed at the location and there's, just a nine hundred year old minor. And they're like finding a waiting time. A sure ivan has got their mind. Well, good news, boys. We finally got something. This shell. A braid it. Just open this bottle of why no, it's evaporated. Yes, we've been waiting here a while. Wait to tell the wives there. No, they've also evaporated. Trump's, president, whoa! That's it, he's straight. We got one more in us who knew everyone. Else's evaporated. The hills. My deal. So so the peace treaty was signed at the location of fort anderson. Students from bryce ville elementary school played homemade instruments as the treaty was signed by. Yeah, well, maybe someone did. Someone hitting a chair with a stick crank, crank, quienes call a harp nano, the kid's banging iraq against a tree trunk trunk. Bryce ville, clunk, clunk. I'll be playing my stomach. Bobby's. Going to fart you? I can only do two. A republican state senator, and I wish i'd written in his name, but I didn't. Republican state senator quote, this is a great way to involve young people in history. Yes, it sure is it's you he was wearing a green bandanna like those he said were worn by striking miners. What there I could find absolutely no mention of anyone wearing green bandanas. I think it all it's, like you said, that moment, when you thank for areas. Bushy mountain state penitentiary continue producing coal, using prison labor until nineteen, sixty six. But the cool thing about prison labor is is is that i'm sure you could go look up what your state does. I didn't get a chance. Fuck you. Might be a prison break. Um, but there's, really great companies that use prison labor now, nordstrom, nordstrom has their clothes made in prison. And so if you were in norse jim it's, a sweet buck twenty five an hour from some poor guy wars and you wear that around. But almost all of our all of our big, great companies who are very successful, like who else? There's, a giant fucking let me look it up. I mean, well, yeah, we're going to start boycotting when you talk about something. Yeah, cold, cole's department stores. Get him not sounds like a nice tie in nice try coles instead of a cnn. Today, we'll do a k a h goals. Okay, so it says, right here, tennessee, yeah, it doesn't list, um, i'm sorry, c c, a corrections corporation, america private operator with bigger well, I know north. I mean, in the country, there are just tons, right? Yeah, if you victoria's secret, that's the secrets. Great. Some guys sit. Finally. Is it really victoria's secret? Could you imagine being some dude and just you're in prison and that you got a hot fucking laundry? That is like fucked up on two levels, right? That's, wrong. And then the guys like, and then the breasts will slowly. Jerry, don't fuck that machine again. I won't. All right. Yeah. Okay, ready? I got ready for the list. Yeah, all right. So these air, these air companies that use prison labor, whole foods. It's. Just tough start. Mcdonald's. They make their containers. They're the things you eat with the forks uniforms. So ask them to give you some sandwich in your hand. Loophole. Don't put it in a bag or anything. Just drop it in my hand. Fifty eight. Weird. Victoria's secret. A teen t call centers. That explains a lot. British petroleum used the prisoners to clean up the oil spill, which is doubly messed up. A cz well, because that's your like again, the chemicals get in the bank of america. Bear cargo, caterpillar, chevron, chrysler, costco, john, deere, ellie, lily and company. Eli lilly and company. Exxon mobil, glafkos, glaxosmithkline, johnson, johnson. Came our coke industries, mcdonald's merc, microsoft, motorola, nintendo, pfizer, procter and gamble, pepsi, conagra foods, shell, starbucks, ups, verizon, walmart, wendy's. When day. There you go. I mean that. But that is right, you asked. At times, how do you like make out, you change shit is stopped buying shit from and that and that's, honestly, that's. Not even the ones that, yeah. It's fun to boycott. I'm excited to boycott whole foods officially been a long time coming, and that kiwis here around something's, off. So, you know, if you've heard lately that prisoners, they're trying to go on strike and stuff, but it's hard because you're in prison, yeah, but it's it's, a legit problem and it's like it is it is a modern day slavery because we're actually putting people in prison who, like she gave me a prison for pot.

They can't have it down streaming camp for lunch way. Way over.\n\nspk_2 : Worse than that.\n\nspk_3 : Nothing. So when they set of kim, will power, refused to even them. Any stand apart on the other men and then cooked on the hawkins would bring him his food. So\n\nspk_2 : he's got a real diva.\n\nspk_3 : They went, really think must have been drinking for the several nights in a row, in the lead up to the trip on. Then they kept coming down. Over the next day, we're\n\nspk_2 : trying my fear of the sandbar. Five days\n\nspk_3 : in, they hit their first rap, it's. Ok, what I stand upon the death of my brother to see a way of marking rocks. Such moments are filled with intense, exciting. Soon our boat speaks, its current way threatened the narrow passage, with exhilarating lost, the mounting high lives. Who's folk pressed ash over us until they reached the quiet water below. And then comes a feeling great as this was our first experience for kenya events, we call the canyon of the rapids s so creative. I mean, you name it,\n\nspk_2 : and I\n\nspk_3 : couldn't take it that you actually just call a band a band. There was a band called the band fine, because it was not like freeman's on that's fun that you could just go, that seems cool. Orange is an orange, is orange. You, you're\n\nspk_2 : yeah. Nice, nice. But you go up there with\n\nspk_3 : jesus. Uh, so what we've got more treacherous is they will soon have another cane. And the great rox, the canyon wheels back upon itself and is in the form of a long letter. You, we don't name it or shoot, kid.\n\nspk_2 : Wow, this you can, you know. Don't even take aboutthe.\n\nspk_3 : They would be the americans on the way, who would say they would never ride the rapids on? They went. Sure, smart. Do not trust the locals\n\nspk_2 : know, would you? You're right, you've got this something, knowledge doesn't. I\n\nspk_3 : mean, why stop believing that you didn't believe it when I said, this is\n\nspk_2 : you guys. Here, wait for us quicker skin.\n\nspk_3 : I was challenging night, quote. I hear shouts, looking around, see one of the boats shooting down the side of the room goes out with the first fall's, only ten and twelve feet on lee, just sugar. The other tumbles down again for forty or fifty feet in the channel building. Dangerous rocks that break the waves in the world's seen devote striking green. Open the open. The compartment on the open compartment fills with water and to amend there's their orders. Boatswain surrounding strikes, another rock, great force it's broken into matter, thrown in through. I see a man about the water. Washington were great. Okay, wait. Call that breaking for fuel line. So frank was going to iraq. I can't be your friend\n\nspk_2 : that, given everything now,\n\nspk_3 : frank out with pole clearly was getting more dangerous. They found the stream about storage compartment down there with kai was too dangerous to try to save what was inside. This been, they would lose the cardinal of rations instruments. Okay. First of all, the bronner's bombers were terminated for determining elevation. Sure, some\n\nspk_2 : tells a little food will become very important. So what? They have three months right now? Three, now three, and they're down a quarter of their rations.\n\nspk_3 : Okay, well, the next day, palestine in fucking he was going to go for the broker, okay, so something done. Volunteer to make the attempt. They come up with the robbers, and now the boys set up a shot and I joined them. Please. They they should be, is glad to save the instruments as myself. Okay, they also salvaged a three count keg of whiskey.\n\nspk_2 : You don't give a shit about barometer.\n\nspk_0 : It turns out,\n\nspk_3 : man, what the members shutting about was not robbers was the whiskey. I didn't even know they have brought with me.\n\nspk_2 : Thank you. Wait. It's.

If I had a dog have a line where my men is made tonight, I would kill him and burgess colors\n\nspk_2 : right now. Easy, I know it's, a diarrhea it's, not time to talk about burning.

And if you don't kill one of them,\n\nspk_2 : you turned thirty. What?\n\nspk_3 : Dang goes to my mattress.\n\nspk_2 : I'm supposed to be there. Look,\n\nspk_3 : thank you. They can't having to try and rations because the rations we get, what during the day? Sure, yeah, that it is none of my business. Yet. If we fail from lack of judgment, every succeed will be from dumb luck. That's. A\n\nspk_2 : good that's, a good place to be a sort of model.\n\nspk_3 : We have. The guy just came with the letters back to lead us. It's also that you bought from america, right? It is. On june sixteenth, they make him and a strong wind blew, and the cooks fire spread to nearby Denver, willows and cedars.

At the only survivor, jack sumner, who told him the details of what happened, jack, you watched helplessly from the shores. All the boats were destroyed at the rabbits in the meadow.\n\nspk_2 : He was just watching. Yeah, okay, pulled the\n\nspk_3 : gun, and john rhys tio told the shot, a tribute, but he was the only survivor of the party. Okay, you have a list of all the party\n\nspk_2 : suri and letters, that's, everything,\n\nspk_3 : including fifteen extra guys who are not on the trip, meant for me. You will never see us again for two hours away on the banks of the river, pride\n\nspk_2 : subjects out of his mind.\n\nspk_3 : The tribune called the fate of major powell's expedition. Is that without a doubt, and another names added to the long list of martyrs to science? Sure, science partners. But\n\nspk_2 : could you imagine a time when just just such bullshit would end up in the paper out there, just as actual facts? You know, we're just like some weirdo, just as a bunch of dump shit, that's, full lies. And then it's just publicly reported. And then you read it and absorb. It is fact, crazy, crazy time.\n\nspk_3 : That's. Usually what a dog!\n\nspk_2 : It was like a ski trip. She likes it up there. She's purring, that's the future. Wait. Always a hypothermic. Now they're fun.\n\nspk_3 : The next day, detroit transference letter, mrs powers, and the story was bullshit. Job. Prison had never been part of the expedition. Plus, she had a letter from her husband, dated a few days after residents said, everyone drowned. Ok, three days later, she talking tribune, pointed out all the problems with the survivor story, which they printed three days before retractions were invented. It was bullshit. On june twenty pounds, forty miles up, a tributary to an indian reservation, hoping to replenish spot's, sure, now, people. On june three, they passed through hollow domes. If they spoke her, there are voices echoed back. Was this the first\n\nspk_2 : time this has happened? Wait. Wow, yeah.\n\nspk_3 : Used to not to try or do leave the dress. That led to the tribe. But it was not impressed with the way they were living. Yeah, hey! What are you doing? You're tense and look at this. They're carrying for\n\nspk_2 : one another. Wait stays and then chuck for change with three spoons, wait. No. Teo.\n\nspk_3 : Wear still, occupying launches and refused to build houses. Bulls. Since when anyone dies in a lodge, it is always abandoned, very optimum burn with all the belongings of the deceased and what houses have been built for them. They've been treated in the same way, so they have a tradition to burn the place for somebody died stuff, way, tio, moving on. Yeah, so when you build a house, their natures to say, there exists it's a lot. It's, a lodging place more than you, it's, a place where that person lives. Yeah, why\n\nspk_2 : would you, colonel your possessions when you can have a drug? Chefs stumble off river, much\n\nspk_3 : what's, the point of it. Having problems with our leadership, what? Yeah, then don't accidentally dropped powell's gold. Watch into the river\n\nspk_2 : wasn't one of these, like gypsies. Sorry, sorry, sorry, I just invented something. Sorry, sorry, sorry, yeah.\n\nspk_3 : Anyway, you used to wear on your hand. In what way? Not, sir. True.\n\nspk_2 : What a water proof watch\n\nspk_3 : pounds I don't either leave expedition are given thirty dollars compensation, nine hundred dollars, and you too much for expensive watches. Move. Well, not expensive. Watch on the river trip. Yes, pal, brother walter said, if done were drowned, it would be no loss, so they're taking the watch the car, serious business to the guys in the party, thought that comment was bullshit parkinson and could not bring west dinner to him anymore. Whoa should get where, taro, that men have reached a state of the union. On july fifth, the englishman painted tag along decided to leave. I\n\nspk_2 : decided you're my best friend. Despite all the money i've given you, I think this is something you may not pay for\n\nspk_0 : it. I can't swim.\n\nspk_3 : Wait. Yeah. On july sixty stop. On july sixth, stop the frontier bands. Carter, who told them if they were ever in the neighborhood, they should help themselves whose car?\n\nspk_2 : He was like that.\n\nspk_3 : It was a matching is no was tending to know they're right. So they decided to just eat the tops of the potato plants, which the face? Great weight. Did you say? The potatoes look nice? Yeah, just with a lot of the plants at the top. One after another, the party is taken sick. No\n\nspk_2 : living like matt damon in the martian.\n\nspk_3 : Nauseous. First, that severe. You tumble around with trees, groaning with pain. Okay, in the middle of way, we're rid of the pain. Jack. Some reports of this terry quote. General tops are not good greens in early july. Sure, I finally read something in my journal. I love him like he was, like, obviously, sees, got better doing young, revered the river became worse. Is they continued on july eleventh and or broken. Another one was lost in a rap there's, a report that they had been trying to reach man, but they couldn't, because they didn't have orders important. The way to lift the boats over, everyone coming to the signs, rolls of blankets, two guns and a brahmin were tossed out.\n\nspk_2 : Jesus, what do they have at this point? Just smooth, like a few plates and a billion some stuff on a toothless chef for the picking, they're essentially\n\nspk_3 : going about with a big spoon on one side to take\n\nspk_2 : food. Let's, just get one arm.\n\nspk_3 : Well, from now on, we may sleep cold, the camp waiting for lost fire ground to make moore's law. Okay, sure. But it was not a great place to camp that. I'm hurricane force winds blew, and they could not find shelter with, well, like pounds of sand over there, westbound lane, team quote, day, spend, it's, friending our rations, which we find are badly injured. The flower has been wet and trying so many times that it is all rusty. Phil, are\n\nspk_2 : you it's? Nice\n\nspk_3 : to, like a lot of musty tio send flowers. We make a stranger of mosquito netting and read our power through it, losing more than two hundred pounds in the process. Our loss is leaving us with more than two months lives,\n\nspk_2 : and they started with ten, and now they, too, like\n\nspk_3 : mother like a month that's\n\nspk_2 : quite a while. Okay,\n\nspk_3 : they started back out three days later, lots of rapids in close succession. One boat got water that was thrown into the river, and three wars were lost. They finally got camped on the rocks with hardly any room to like that. If I drink, what biltmore whores. Now, the boats were continually leading today. Stop constantly calling. And what's, not five men, tried to climb a cliff to get a look down river. The term. Except now. Yeah, how? Explain that way inclined canyon walls, quote by locals and craps. I support myself. Impressive back gets the one wall on my knees, against together this way with my body and shuffling manner a few inches at a time,\n\nspk_2 : but he should not be you. This is not like he's, not successfully climbing it's, not time to apart. It was the big keeps getting caught on the rocks\n\nspk_3 : while he's making up for it this time.\n\nspk_2 : You know what? He's got access to the facts.\n\nspk_3 : At the top, you look down on the river. Look even more dangerous. Back. Really jesus. That day I killed the ship that they're able to eat well for a bit, fish are not biting at all on there because there were so many bugs for them to eat. They were now heading down what they call the great know it was a forty seven. They're pushing into the Grand Canyon they had a month's rations left it z, they had to reset the flower, and the spoiled thinking was trying something a little confused about how they just now trying to make. And what was going on was maybe just get in the boat. What's going on, his name's laying around. Yeah, it's. Big\n\nspk_2 : no, you definitely. If you're starving, making should take presidents\n\nspk_3 : of her. But the biggest thing the flower is big. Cheer to the point you carry around in the welders,\n\nspk_2 : I think insert from my gut\n\nspk_3 : over here. Yes, preaches it is you can actually just take making\n\nspk_2 : out. You could just travel with bacon. You could have wrote bacon Denver holder big. You cured it out. So you can just run around with your bacon in your back pocket.\n\nspk_3 : You solved it. You solved it. And then you carry around gun. But then it tastes like shit. But I guess it keeps you alive. Sometimes you reach out to the audience about making how many can do that, just your world. I do that. The killings are first, and then insulted itself. And then he told you about the aids thing.\n\nspk_2 : This is grant this civilian rock salt around hands to cure this defeat that I killed with bone marrow. I\n\nspk_3 : got a crime. Reyes and I go on our pig. And I put it in the crime rates. And I saw him. Julian there's. Only not tonight. I think I have someone coming to church with. What? Some of it is that way. Cleveland so now, a month of rations left, flowers resented. Swell making is tried on fifty pounds left. Sugar melting, disappearing\n\nspk_2 : with wonka's factory. Yeah.\n\nspk_3 : Our but they did have tons of coffee.\n\nspk_2 : That's, terrible. Jacked\n\nspk_3 : up freedom changed this country way. Steve, like fucking.\n\nspk_2 : What? Tell me in a dream. Yeah. No, wait. Yours. Just another back home, I think. We gotta make it so obvious in\n\nspk_3 : the next day, the walls of the canyon, son, let me give very narrow quote. We name this narrow canyon\n\nspk_2 : like so. This is sort of the invention of marketing, too. Genius\n\nspk_3 : it's. The next day, on the river again, encountered a limestone can polish like marble polished. The body became more on brad, quote. If pal does not do something soon, I fear the consequences, but he is contented and seems to think that biscuits made of sour and musty flower on a few tried annapolis is ample to sustain a laboring man. If you could only studied geology would be happy without food or shelter. The rest of us are not, to an alarming extent. Well, okay, there is. They were fifty miles of continuous whitewater and two hours, and then stop. How climbed up to serve it. Bad news. Up ahead was hellish white water. The rocks are jagan, and they were black and not at the weekend boats as they near them. It's. It was a sound like nothing they've ever heard. They were now dealing with fifteen foot point.\n\nspk_2 : Ten bucks\n\nspk_3 : survive for a week from the lack of food quality food. And they made more for mr spratt\n\nspk_2 : of this, our biscuits were not enough.\n\nspk_3 : Friendly foot could spread out all the rations, too dry. It was making yours when the title was swung around by the many, and the rope got the box of thinking, so and through it all, into the river. So now we must\n\nspk_2 : eat unleavened bread. Ten months of rations. And because you're a\n\nspk_3 : fucking I was like fuck and jack tripper from three's company. Just drop it the next day, and how about the rations were spoiling? The bacon was thrown in the flour last just ten days. Still what?\n\nspk_2 : That's. Hunger suppressing, so that's. Good.\n\nspk_3 : They would have to move fast. And if they were delayed, that have to abandon the expedition. Medford. Nearby mormon sounds.\n\nspk_2 : We'll take our chances. I have one arm. And I mean, when I say let's, swim for it.\n\nspk_3 : And now the brothers were broken.\n\nspk_2 : Not one for how badly this is going inside.\n\nspk_3 : Next day, it rained like a monsoon. She's thie campus was now ronon and useless. They're rubber gauchos have been lost. No one had a full set of clothing, no one had a blanket. Half of them do not have hats,\n\nspk_2 : no. Wait could make hits on our hands. Yes. Syrian basically dead. Obviously, i'm not gonna push back a perfect plan. Wait, mother. Let's, kill the ship like that kind of facing gourmet\n\nspk_3 : fuck. Want to change the plan?\n\nspk_2 : What do you want? I think the guy's hand should live, but I haven't had to\n\nspk_3 : kill the guys who had to take there.\n\nspk_2 : No, we're about to do happy. No, I know this is gonna be like beating. It's in their hands, they lost their minds\n\nspk_3 : that they were now getting more exhausted by the knights and buy the days on the river.\n\nspk_2 : We didn't have our sleeping capsule.\n\nspk_3 : They kept on. They open their last sack of our being linked to the sapphic tats\n\nspk_2 : flower. Mr.\n\nspk_3 : So when I was just, I don't think we can make a hat out of the flower. Who said that?\n\nspk_2 : It was kind of rude. This is is a bad\n\nspk_3 : one, because now we can eat and we don't have that\n\nspk_2 : way. But we were so close to having animal hats, you have to see the upside. We're going to die. What we were gonna die the whole time. It is not a\n\nspk_3 : few nights with general that's, always one.\n\nspk_2 : I swear, if I make it out of here, i'm livin edible that's!\n\nspk_3 : And that man invented edible arrangements. What's\n\nspk_2 : the point of flowers, can you? Arrangements. Give her a melon rose. Tell her. Have this arrangements. What\n\nspk_3 : the fuck is wrong with\n\nspk_2 : weighty to be white?\n\nspk_3 : So thirty five next day actually started hoping maybe through\n\nspk_2 : full atmosphere, but\n\nspk_3 : then they saw black grant that was a sign that hellish napkins were ahead. Sound of these rapids made the others pale. In comparison, they stopped to live with the rabbit's foot. The spectacle is appalling. They look for ways to carry their boats around. It was impossible. Remember not brand quote, there's discontent in the camp tonight, I fear some of the party will take the mountains, but I hope not. This is the darkest day of the trip. After dinner, captain holland's looked couple saying that they should abandon the river. Mark twain, mormon Celtic how this younger brother and lady done, and you walk away from the river tomorrow, regardless in the morning, and show them there was a mormon settlement seventy five, they practiced together in silence. Meal is solid as a few.\n\nspk_2 : You're just chewing flower everyone's, forty flower power.\n\nspk_3 : After you. Three men, two rivals to shock a fair share rations for the men didn't think they had a problem. I\n\nspk_2 : mean, what do you do? Booth.\n\nspk_3 : Still. The man in the boat Celtic got fossil beetles, and some ammunition left them on the rocks. They wanna head down these references, like pasta. How old the letter to his wife. Give it to helen somewhere. Give how? Just watch to get to his sister. There were two separate records of the expedition duplicates for back. They accidentally gave our conference. Now, here is a book of the german on very similar one, and we will keep the okay. You sure you take those ones that look like\n\nspk_2 : absolute? So they just had letters to their wives that way. Are you being like this?\n\nspk_3 : Three men. Bank is not. What we were saying was, madness would never get through. They'll start to cry\n\nspk_2 : further, dehydrated for\n\nspk_3 : the tragedy. Also just tired.\n\nspk_2 : It's really sad, but it's, just so predictable. But it's\n\nspk_3 : also the best. Because when you hear about, like, the great adventurous,\n\nspk_2 : like I\n\nspk_3 : told you, is that these heroes just crossed. You never really hear about them. Just waiting\n\nspk_0 : bythe. What? Wait. Wait. Wait. Good. Wallace\n\nspk_2 : wait. No, no way. You're tired. A terrorist group. You have a sprinkler.\n\nspk_0 : From what? No! I feel better. Wait, brother. Husbands, you know. No.\n\nspk_2 : All right, now that are both sins are back in check. Wayne knows that. I do not like this. Don't pull it. I love you, damn it! Quick who's\n\nspk_3 : that yet it is a rather solemn warming. Each party thinks the other is taking pictures, of course. Georgia bradley. Will they love us with good feelings that we deeply regret their loss, for they are it's fine fellows have ever had the good fortune to meet. The six got into the boats, they wrote, until the rapids were too large, then just held on, but neither slept over and then made it through well, three were watching about from a cliff, so the men in the boats waved aboutthe cliff, signalling that they make it through that they should join them.\n\nspk_2 : Now. A dutch\n\nspk_3 : left back up both case, but the three men turned away and walked on. Slurs. Alabama. This separation point. Separation now. Now why's his name times. Poor decision. They were now go. They were now, innit? For terrifying rapids follows whirlpools and big way to what point above was thrown thirty feet into the air. What noise? Point break. Eventually, huge went away, went over them than a huge wave hit roll over them. So how friendly god, the boat, right side up on the scramble back, and they went on like this for days. The next day I got is you in the river, best out of the black granite and ours there on august twenty, but I think it's trucked away and they entered a family. They used to be grand, it was over, they were ecstatic. Thank you. We started heading out and came across a native american can. All of them ran off? Except one man, a woman and two kids man was wearing at the moment, only a string of beads. They're like what? What's going on out there.\n\nspk_2 : Guys. Alice. We're all thinking the same thing. What would it be like to get into that three? What? The leader. You guys know wiener knots.\n\nspk_3 : The americans asked for tobacco. The men didn't have any, so they give him a little piece of color. So\n\nspk_2 : you go like that. What we do actually have his coffee, we'll get much coffee, coffee with thirty days, just like coffee. Well, actually, I don't have what you're asking for. What we do have a little black cars off limits, you know, way less everything would be none of us have eaten. We touched wieners together, something on one arm. A bunch of guys die in the shed, you thick extra tool in l a will be absent, but coffee, it's, great coffee, coffee, coffee. This. Electrical\n\nspk_3 : even so, the americans would give up any info about Celtic, sort of another native camps\n\nspk_2 : way. Blacks. B hey, little\n\nspk_3 : while later, they found three more men, and they needed american official. The men knew about the expedition is at the party that were lost a long time ago. A few weeks before, best german sent, with instructions to look pretty pieces of boats or anything else living downstream. So far, big stuff like that\n\nspk_2 : never assigned\n\nspk_3 : your face is a bit like nineteen awards. Celtic four. Yeah, I took it to cabinet. Cooked up a bunch of food bishop for myself, twenty miles away. Camera supplies, yet two or three dozen club. We ate the melons till morning.\n\nspk_2 : This is nice. Could you shape it like a flower? No, that is a great sound, that is.\n\nspk_3 : Melanie this whole\n\nspk_0 : trip, and i'm gonna fucking kill myself. Free god! Balance!\n\nspk_2 : No! Yeah! What? Tripping all over me, I needed to have drawn.\n\nspk_3 : So they split up now. Brother headed for settlement of st george and then Salt Lake City four others kept on going down there, over to scout for mining and captain traffic areas. They were considering going all the way to los angeles\n\nspk_2 : actors trying to act like an injury. Story. It's called waiter for no\n\nspk_3 : Salt Lake City treated like a conquering hero from the front Grand Canyon gardens of praise and glory. The news wrote that not many men learn what people thought of them after they were supposed to be dead. How lecture tour with these coast to distract the trip has put pain and blue and terror. A few months later, they decided to do it again. I'm taking the same route once through the rapids, the canyon's. This time, you could take two or three years that he's, just like one of those guys, get back from war. Really, really justice, society, he's faking tio. Go on, do it! Is it state to on a? I'm telling you, I just want to wake you. Yeah, but living with you.\n\nspk_2 : It's like a lot of danger. Hell, I don't know what I was gonna do. Except for another tour. Just one. I was saying it was hell. I couldn't believe it. But enough about my parents.\n\nspk_3 : Might be. They sent it supplies every one or two hundred miles on\n\nspk_2 : eight years of supplies,\n\nspk_3 : mr we live in to set up so that people set him up before they went okay, congress give twenty thousand dollars, he said, that local tribes and he was off, so they're out there, and they came across a remote tribe, and they offer them food. There was pipe smoking ceremony that stories were told. I told him about the world, the chief told the story. You before three white men come to the village star that exhausted,\n\nspk_2 : oh, my god, try defending\n\nspk_3 : reported them to form in settlements nearby, just after the whiteman left, a native from a nearby tribe came and said three whites and children can be a woman to try and assume the man had done it. They pursue, ambushed and called, filled them full of arrows. That was the end of our brothers and\n\nspk_2 : william dunne. It was done. Yeah. Last\n\nspk_3 : words were fuck. I knew my name. I knew it. I knew it. Power, quote. That night, I slept in peace, although these murders of my men were sleeping five hundred yards away, but still. Theo trying now rats, which meant are off. All the tribe named you a\n\nspk_2 : way. You may be legally married. Sounds like people\n\nspk_3 : that looks more daring can cross over million clips, hundreds of feet high.\n\nspk_2 : A those\n\nspk_3 : he named them for my lips. I got a chip chip three years in a book.\n\nspk_2 : I hate my life.\n\nspk_3 : The department meeting affairs has called to write the report. And he said the natives understood Celtic by the white man was inevitable. But nothing that remains mature. Move them from the country. Or let them say their present conditions to be finally extinguished by want oaths of disease and disasters from constant conflict with white man, they must be taught to farm to enable them to abandon their nomadic. And they say, travel broadens the mind.\n\nspk_2 : This is before that travel broadens your land well. That's.\n\nspk_3 : Your message. Hey, was appointed head of the u s geological survey in eighteen, eighty one in eighteen eighty three. Report our lands of regions of us. Pal proposed irrigation systems and state mammaries based on water shin areas to avoid disagreements between states. I'm talking about twenty years, hey said. About two percent planning to develop for agricultural use. The railroad companies do not agree with this. They live in congress to reject his proposals, encourage farming instead because they want to cash in on their lands. Congress passed legislation encouraging fire yourself, the american west and eighteen, eighty three irrigation conference, which I\n\nspk_2 : love all those exciting. Fucking wintertime! Sweet irrigation. They dig, I wet. It's no.\n\nspk_3 : How are gentlemen, you are piling up a heritage of conflict in litigation over water rights, for there is not sufficient water. Just fly the plane in paolo's letter. That's weird times magazine this week. Now, the later years, you turned to writing about philosophy. But few understand. These later products have less power.

It is j r th it's, a welsh name, and there's been some miscommunication from I don't know how it started. I don't even know how it began, it seems organic. It certainly wasn't my man\n\nspk_1 : dairy over here. He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't dare. E savor that one, guys. The\n\nspk_2 : problem is, is that, uh, gary's a name,\n\nspk_1 : share and terry's a lifestyle? Yeah, dairy dairy\n\nspk_2 : is a food, so it doesn't make sense. I want you to tell the audience the story just told me about your mom going to her first baseball game.\n\nspk_1 : Well, so she never been to a baseball game, so my brother and I took her to a brewers game, and she wass okay, guys on dh, she wass. She was starting to get like I asked, dave, I was like, what do youse I was like, what do you say? One like, using your kid's baseball game and kids strikes out he's, like, sit down, sit down, and I was I had a picture that, but then, so my mother's at the game doesn't know anything. And then by a rat like the eighth inning she's kind of into it, and one of the guys on the other team strikes out, and she stands up and goes,\n\nspk_0 : that's it. You go to your little house\n\nspk_1 : pointing to the dugout a little. We were like, good, sit down, sit down, mom. It was like coming to america was like,\n\nspk_0 : take a seat. Don't you're listening to the dollar? Yeah.\n\nspk_2 : This is ah, by american history podcast. Because of what happened backstage. We're going to be in australia in october.\n\nspk_1 : What a tease. Jesus, man, help the\n\nspk_2 : podcast, dot com for all our tour Cleveland new york, we've got a bunch of cities coming up.\n\nspk_1 : Well, then i'll be in\n\nspk_0 : december fifteen, nineteen, ninety two. What year?\n\nspk_2 : Eighteen, ninety two.\n\nspk_1 : Okay, i'll be in albany, in austin. Coming up, go to garrett reynolds. Dot com for all side shows in an eighteen, ninety two. Yeah, yeah, albany. Yeah, albany, new york. What? Don't help. What\n\nspk_2 : crime did you commit to have to go to albany, new york, to do\n\nspk_1 : comedy, white collar that's? What we all go?\n\nspk_2 : Everyone's going to know soon? John paul getty was born in minneapolis, minnesota. Two parents, george getty and sarah getty sarah, gave birth. Teo called them paul when, when she was forty. Okay, well, yeah, for eighteen nineteen. Yeah, I would imagine, probably that's remark of something that happened after\n\nspk_1 : now, brigitte nielsen it fifty five. What? Yeah, I just had a baby at fifty five. Fuck you talking about brigitte nielsen, who\n\nspk_0 : put it in\n\nspk_1 : there, sly stallone, it's, a sequel, the fuck, the last part's alive, but I don't know who did it, but, yeah, I just had a baby, and I feel fine, yeah, no, not a toddler, fifty five, a baby, yeah, inside\n\nspk_0 : of her\n\nspk_1 : know, on the outside, like a heart. It's going\n\nspk_2 : to come out of her like\n\nspk_0 : it came out of her. But it already came out.\n\nspk_2 : Fifty five years old.\n\nspk_1 : She's, fifty five. The baby's. Not much younger.\n\nspk_2 : I don't wanna do this anymore. So they called him paul. George was a successful, Minneapolis insurance man, okay, sold insurance. Probably a lot here, parents. George bought the oil rights of some land and quickly struck it rich. He called his company, mina homa. Oil\n\nspk_1 : men home oil, it's,\n\nspk_2 : a combination of minnesota and oklahoma.\n\nspk_1 : Well, it is very catchy. It doesn't feel frankenstein it all.\n\nspk_0 : Mitya homa. Imagine the\n\nspk_1 : unveiling of that people like,\n\nspk_0 : oh, ah, good, really good. I put the names\n\nspk_1 : together. I mean, okla soda just sounded ridiculous. Okla soda sounds like a sports drink, min.\n\nspk_0 : Okla mina homa. No, stop suggesting other name oklahoman. My god, everyone leave the party! Leave the unveiling. I've\n\nspk_1 : gone all in on this. Okla hoda, okla hoda it's okla dokka okay, okay, soda. Wait. Now. I forgot what he went with. What did he actually go in? Uh, i'm wrapped. I'm wrapped up in here, i've wrestled my mind. What was the what? Did he actually go with min? A home, a home. Okay, right, right\n\nspk_2 : by nineteen o six, georges, a millionaire. Wow, but george assume paul would one day take over the family business. Sure, why not now? Paul was an only child. Hey should have been. He had a younger sister died just after being born, okay, because that is the law, right? Yeah. So sarah was obviously thrown by the death of her child, so she didn't allow paul to have contact with other children because you might get a virus.\n\nspk_1 : You okay? So right there, that is a great parenting decision, you know,\n\nspk_2 : keep your getaway from other kids.\n\nspk_1 : The jenny mccarthy move, just mccarthy. Yeah, that's, mccarthyism, isn't it? Yeah, so i've been told when I\n\nspk_2 : think less people died from mccarthyism. No, she's. Good, I okay forever. I've taken my health advice from playmates.\n\nspk_1 : Hi. Hurry up! I'm growing a beard, sir\n\nspk_2 : was also careful not to love paul too much,\n\nspk_0 : right again. Yes, yes, sarah,\n\nspk_1 : yes, yes, because he might die also, yes, yes, because he loved the first one will be, of course, he will be pining for the affection of friends, but he can't have those, and then you also pull back. Just sort of, you know, hopefully creating a void so large you can see it. Yeah, yeah, sort of like a black hole in the kid's stomach.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, i'm sure i'm sure it'll be fine.\n\nspk_0 : He'll be fine. I mean, he's. Big feature on this. I'm\n\nspk_2 : sure he's sure this might be that one that's about the nicest guy ever, okay, as a child, they began to hide his emotions and kept his feelings to himself. I wonder why\n\nspk_1 : not? No idea.\n\nspk_2 : Paul was quiet and sullen later in life, a longtime associate would describe him as always, quote, looking like he was attending his own funeral.\n\nspk_1 : Wow, yeah, that's fucked that layered that's, not just it looks like he's at a funeral, his and he's bummed, areyou smiling. It\n\nspk_0 : seems like if you're miserable\n\nspk_1 : in this world, if you have the appearance of someone who's happy at their own funeral, you'd be like,\n\nspk_0 : ah, wei,\n\nspk_1 : yeah. Instead of just being like god, I miss me. That\n\nspk_0 : was so young. I'd like\n\nspk_2 : to say a couple words about myself.\n\nspk_0 : Yes, what can I say about me that I haven't said already,\n\nspk_2 : man. Ah young paul became obsessed with girls it's weird when you start with someone of affection and love that they would then become obsessed with girls but that's what happened\n\nspk_1 : right mom stopped lifeguarding at this point I guess\n\nspk_2 : by the age of fourteen he was telling people he had already lost his virginity interesting okay it wasn't great sarah and george were very religious sure so then sarah decided minnesota was too cold or maybe just to get paul away from the influences he either they moved to los angeles so she like let's get\n\nspk_0 : she's like he's trying to fuck too much let's go to l a probably yeah I think the winners when he's really out there being active I don't think she knows what the midwest men winners\n\nspk_1 : air like that's not that's not prime hunting season that's when people like you want to go outside or how do you want to handle today tell\n\nspk_2 : people just stay inside and\n\nspk_0 : fuck yeah but you need tohave you it's not like you're out there playing\n\nspk_1 : the field and like you know negative seventeen degree weather you're not like a let's go I want to take a walk what if\n\nspk_2 : you're stuck outside and you have to rub your generals against someone to stay warm? Is that a thing like you know like in a parking lot like\n\nspk_1 : it's just not go\n\nspk_2 : where walgreens parking lot used\n\nspk_0 : like i'm like way robin what no that's robin told her warm. Yeah. Oh, my god, a baby, it's. What you're fifty five.\n\nspk_2 : So paul went to work for mina homo oil. It sounds worse. Every time you say, yeah. Absolutely. I sent him to oklahoma to search for oil. He bought oil leases and soon made a million dollars for the company. Wow, yeah, so bad. So I went home to los angeles, and in nineteen nineteen, he started buying oil fields in california. Now, paul at a thing for young virgins.\n\nspk_1 : So, my god, that is like a haymaker. You just threw that's. What is a sucker punch? Wow, okay, that's,\n\nspk_2 : not old ones. Young ones\n\nspk_1 : know, right?\n\nspk_0 : I've been waiting. Nine, fifty four haven't been fucked yet. Fifty for first time. I want to make a baby.\n\nspk_1 : I loved you in beverly hills cop, too. Jesus. Okay, so that's, a detail that it feels like well matter. Unfortunately. On\n\nspk_2 : october nineteen twenty three, he married seventeen year old, a seventy year old high schooler in mexico.\n\nspk_1 : How old is he?\n\nspk_2 : Thirty one. She quickly got pregnant, which disgusted paul.\n\nspk_1 : Not the name I thought was going to be coming. Wow, okay, so\n\nspk_2 : you're fucking gross. Who did that to you?\n\nspk_0 : You did what you did was fuck you, I didn't do that that's, how this happened, you eighty eight\n\nspk_2 : that's. Why, I said butthole. So uh, so. So he was so disgusted with her pregnant condition that he's that he left his teenage wife.\n\nspk_0 : What are you going to do, she's, all gross and full of\n\nspk_2 : baby? No, I mean it's, like she's human, so she would later say he was abusive three years, so\n\nspk_1 : you had it all,\n\nspk_2 : yeah. Three years later, he met another teenager and married her in mexico. Jesus, but then they split up. At that point, he took a vacation to europe, where he met seventeen year old dauphine feeny. Emily. He was thirty six, she's says they loped and moved to l a.\n\nspk_1 : Okay, this is quite a run.\n\nspk_2 : She got pregnant, and paul became disgusted with her.\n\nspk_1 : Oh, my god, what? What is it about the women that I choose?\n\nspk_2 : They're so great. When I meet them.\n\nspk_1 : A couple of\n\nspk_2 : fucks, and they're gross. I got to meet a fifty four year old.\n\nspk_1 : Hello, paul,\n\nspk_0 : what the fuck?\n\nspk_2 : So sophie anne went back to germany, right? Okay, but paul did not want to pay for a divorce, so they lived apart but married, so okay,\n\nspk_0 : so he has a couple active marriages at the same time,\n\nspk_2 : no he's, divorced he's, divorces from mars, these the last two this's, the first one, he hasn't divorced, right, okay, s o s. Oh, then george died, and paul became president of george getty incorporated. Okay, he also started dating a twenty one year old in the fall of\n\nspk_1 : o so easy, he's, still mad old well, still,\n\nspk_2 : actually, you say a little old, but they had. Ridge originally met when she was fourteen, when he tried to seduce her. Okay, like you've never tried to cities a fourteen year old,\n\nspk_0 : how do you even call that seduction? I think I think\n\nspk_2 : fourteen year old should be able to carry swords. And then and then the guy comes up and they just go. Right through someone, they just turn it to the side a little bit, and he goes, I wanted to fuck him, and then his guts come out, she goes.\n\nspk_0 : It was mid seduction. I was seducing you\n\nspk_2 : well, can't. A forty year old trying to fuck a fourteen year old anymore? What happened to america is this alabama roy mohr. So so, yeah,\n\nspk_1 : cool. Okay, great. So he was,\n\nspk_2 : but now she's. Now she's legal, right, she's twenty one. Sure, on dh. Now, the dad who was upset, he tried to fuck us. Donna would choose fourteen now, a millionaire's role in the news after and she's legal and he's like, yeah, cool. So the dow was on board. Okay, great cools also. Great, yeah, fuck him, fuck them all. They're all monsters. I'm going to cut my balls off after the show. In solidarity. Troubling language. So so he's, still he's, still married tio, the german with chairman, and then the twenty year old got pregnant. Somehow,\n\nspk_1 : i've got a bad feeling about his reaction to this.\n\nspk_2 : No, it's fine. Paul was disgusted\n\nspk_1 : by her thanks already.\n\nspk_0 : I i'm starting to think he's the problem. A little bit so.\n\nspk_2 : Eso this one sad\n\nspk_0 : what was what kind of\n\nspk_1 : protection was there back then? Well,\n\nspk_2 : oh, well, I mean, a long time ago,\n\nspk_1 : they invented pulling\n\nspk_2 : out. They invented pulling out, then I don't know if they still use reusable condom, but condoms were reusable through time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would get, like the bladder of a pig or whatever, and then you would you would just reuse it, you'd wash it and I guess put it in the dishwasher rack or whatever. Andi, just keep using that bad boy. Wow, I don't know when that star\n\nspk_0 : i'm starting a new\n\nspk_1 : podcast called questions. I wish I hadn't asked, and this is going to be the first episode also, so it'll be a fun little crossover. But at\n\nspk_2 : this point nineteen thirty, I don't know in condoms were invented, but probably not yet latex that's, a\n\nspk_1 : test group. You want to get involved with france? Of course,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, yeah. France, of course, is france. You're late. You missed it all. Fuck. Guy doesn't like girls fucks him, they get pregnant, and then he doesn't he's like\n\nspk_1 : that. Anyways, to fuck a pig in a woman at the same time.\n\nspk_2 : He's, a funder, picking technics, same time. Okay, all right, you're caught up. Okay, welcome back. Okay, so so he's, still married, gois gets his twenty year old, twenty one year old mistress, pregnant, he's. Disgusted by her, she tries to kill herself by drinking, I add nine jeane. Thankfully, thankfully, she's arrived, and then she gave birth on september seven nineteen thirty two to paul's third son, who he named john paul getty junior. So okay, the third, this\n\nspk_1 : is john paul getty jr the son it's, a second sorry, the second. So we've got a paul, a paul and then his younger right\n\nspk_2 : junior, so we're going to call the second one junior, okay, not paul jr\n\nspk_1 : was just so we've got paul and junior\n\nspk_2 : got paul in junior now, okay, thank you, s oh, paul divorced, ah, feeny, and he married.\n\nspk_1 : It was feeney,\n\nspk_2 : feeney.

He built a concrete bunker where he lived in work. I mean, because, you know, oklahoma, with the germans, bombing oklahoma\n\nspk_1 : all the time. Well, they were against mina homa, more than anyone, the germans. They\n\nspk_0 : must get rid of me, mama, go sota! In nineteen forty\n\nspk_2 : one, sarah getty there should be more to that. Okay, I think she died. She must have died. There is that sense is gone.\n\nspk_1 : Jesus, which that sentence is gone. When we got off with a death for understand, assume she died. From what way can we just strolling gigs say, blimp rolled? She died from all. Okay, fair enough.\n\nspk_2 : So paul kept kept fucking the lady, even though she was getting pregnant and wait, which lady andi, wait who's married to now\n\nspk_1 : that he's married to someone you know,\n\nspk_2 : the twenty three year old right, the singer\n\nspk_1 : singer who's from another come, but then she came back, comes in\n\nspk_2 : during the war. She got put in term of camp, and she got out, came home. Jesus. Okay, well, we got it. You got to get to the depths to be good singer and goto.\n\nspk_1 : I don't know that sedative that works.\n\nspk_2 : So they made a baby his fifth. I was born in nineteen forty six in los angeles. Of course, paul is living in oklahoma, so he didn't. He didn't come see the baby, she was disgusted. Yeah, fucking baby came out. Why would you go see that? I'm sure you have discussed it. Paulman, an oil deal with saudi arabia and kuwait in nineteen fifty three, which described by fortune magazine as, quote, somewhere between colossal and history, making\n\nspk_1 : quite a specific scale, they've got going there for themselves, isn't it?\n\nspk_2 : In nineteen fifty six, he change the company name from pacific western to getty oil company. Okay, uh, now paul had a mistress, penelope kitson, his busy guy, huh? I like to fuck, yeah, yeah, yeah, they didn't marry because of fortune. Teller had told paul that if he married for a six time, he would die.\n\nspk_0 : So he can. He can\n\nspk_1 : learn he is capable of lessons. It's just they need to come from a shiny ball. Well, I think\n\nspk_2 : he was done with merrick.\n\nspk_0 : I mean, imagine if a fortune\n\nspk_1 : teller said something like that to you what your reaction would be if you get married a six time you'll die. Yes, well, I should not do\n\nspk_0 : that. She's right? I do. I love her. This cost thirty five dollars, she's absolutely right, scott beads on the door and everything\n\nspk_2 : but the fortune teller thing might not have been true because paul would often quote fortune tellers to excuse things he did and avoid doing other things.\n\nspk_0 : Wait, what do you sorry say that again,\n\nspk_2 : like if you don't want to do something like, oh, no, fortune teller told me\n\nspk_1 : that he just used that as like a scapegoat. Uh, honey, I can't take out the\n\nspk_0 : guy ridge, remember the fortune teller said, yeah like that I could drive fine\n\nspk_1 : after a few drinks, a fortune teller told me I wouldn't die in a drunk driving accident. I'm invincible drunk driving fortune teller\n\nspk_0 : says. Because I can't get women pregnant, a fortune teller told me. Good luck, you disgusting animal!\n\nspk_1 : If only my condom was it in the sink. You know,\n\nspk_0 : around this\n\nspk_2 : time, paul became convinced that he had been roman emperor adrian in\n\nspk_0 : the past life. Nobody well, body. Well, buddy, well, but he won't. Well, buddy, body,\n\nspk_1 : body, body, body, god, but but but but but\n\nspk_0 : but but anybody, anybody sell bad. He wants more.\n\nspk_2 : He became convinced that he had been roman emperor hadrian in a past life, like we all haven't been there some time or another. We want smile like I was like,\n\nspk_0 : come on, I had to\n\nspk_1 : been caligula. Oh, my god, okay, so that's, who and what was that? I mean, you know, i'm obviously big into greek history and roman history, which everyone, you said it was rotten, the border is some specifics of the reincarnated. What I don't\n\nspk_0 : know. You know why\n\nspk_2 : this was so long? I was like, I can't go into that.\n\nspk_1 : He was obsessed with fortune tellers.\n\nspk_2 : I think he was just just just figured, this guy's, super powerful, and I am, too. No, we're probably bro's\n\nspk_1 : going that fortune teller was like jack pot. I\n\nspk_2 : probably should have looked more to that, but I didn't. I just read that, and I was like, yeah, okay,\n\nspk_1 : I mean, for me, i'm really just picturing ghostbusters to. So, yeah, sort of sort of, kind of a little bit you planning on standing\n\nspk_0 : for the rest. I\n\nspk_2 : like standing right now. I think they're fine with it. Sure, yeah. Uh, in nineteen, fifty eight, has some son timmy died during an operation. Okay? And paul, for some reason, was sad, which is surprising. He then said, life was worthless.\n\nspk_0 : Jesus, but he hated kids.\n\nspk_2 : I know, okay, the one he never went to see when he was born anyway.\n\nspk_0 : What they thought a shit\n\nspk_2 : he bought on italian house and moved there he bought, okay hey became paranoid. He was, he became very paranoid and was convinced he would be kidnapped by pirates.\n\nspk_0 : Whoa, that is again really specific\n\nspk_2 : well, because because the house was near the sea.\n\nspk_1 : Still, I mean that's, like you don't know what you don't know for sure they are pirates, but I mean that's, like quite a.\n\nspk_2 : You make fun of the guy until pirates come and kidnap him, and then you're like, oh, it was right,\n\nspk_1 : yeah, for sure,\n\nspk_2 : he's, right, about timmy. What? So he put bars on the windows and had intense security. He kept a loaded shotgun in his bedroom and never stayed in the house for very long. Okay, cool, nice vibe. Now, junior never saw much of his father. When he was twelve, he wrote him a letter,\n\nspk_1 : so you could tell the parenting skills have been passed down. Yeah, it was like, I never saw dad much. You're not supposed to know i'm your parent and of your\n\nspk_0 : own life. Without your friends alone,\n\nspk_1 : you go crazy, then you blame everyone for the rest of\n\nspk_0 : your life, for everything. I mean, everybody, kid, before it was a roman emperor,\n\nspk_1 : something I can't remember.\n\nspk_2 : Paul returned the letter.\n\nspk_1 : You mean, like, returned to sender?\n\nspk_2 : He returned it on answered. With the spelling mistakes corrected. Know what? Someone finally is worse than my dad. I mean, holy fucking shit,\n\nspk_0 : like on dh. Surely\n\nspk_1 : that letter was, like some kind of olive branches, just like, oh, you know, I mean, I wish we could hang out, you know, somebody. And then just, like, gets that back, like, this is the worst thing to give back. This is worse than a fuck you letter or no letter. This is, you know, there's, an e and lonely. There's, no eye and sad. Sure feels like there is.\n\nspk_2 : So he grew up, you know, not not without really knowing his dad. Cool junior fought in the korean war and when he returned, he married gail harris in january nineteen fifty six. Paul did not go to the wedding, right? He was disgusted. No, he's still discuss it. He did, however, send his mistress. Mistress penelope? No, sorry, he did not send his mistress penelope. She made him send congratulations, which he did via telegram. Nice. Congratulations on your marriage. Stop! Seriously, stop!\n\nspk_1 : And for the record he's riding stop before the actual stops.\n\nspk_2 : Junior surgeon, you need a Job in 19:56. He contacted his half brother george, who got junior a job pumping gas at a gary one getty or getty oil own gas station that's a that's an auto? Correct. Okay, so we got\n\nspk_1 : a job, but i'm aware of how slippery slope that can be\n\nspk_2 : so that's cool. So junior got a job but I guess\n\nspk_1 : it's something. Yes, but yeah, for some of his father's, right?\n\nspk_2 : In october nineteen fifty seven fortune magazine named paul the richest living american he was used to anonymity but was now in the spotlight. Quote to my cute discomfort I became a curiosity, a sort of financial freak overnight, okay, nobody cares, yeah so junior was then given training for job tidewater oil headquarters, which getty oil owned. And in nineteen fifty eight, paul contacted him about working for getty oil in the mideast middle east. Paul tell junior to bring his family to paris so he could meet them. Uh, right. For the first time, i'm going to meet the meet, the wife and the kid.\n\nspk_1 : He literally has not met them, you know, it's good, right? Yeah, it's, normal,\n\nspk_2 : for sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. Paul had shingles, but he still enjoyed his son's family.\n\nspk_1 : It's. A very specific thing to know,\n\nspk_2 : but he was suffering, but he still even even throw that suffering. He was able to enjoy\n\nspk_1 : what a trouper gail and right. He was still able to meet his family.\n\nspk_2 : When he met gail, he looked at junior and said, quote, no one told me that your wife was pretty\n\nspk_1 : jesus. It's, quite the smooth talker still got it. Still got it.\n\nspk_0 : Check out your wife's tits, the great. Like, uh,\n\nspk_2 : rats at night. So he very much enjoyed spending time with gail and his grandson, and he took his daughter in law out for dinner and dancing.\n\nspk_1 : Uh,\n\nspk_2 : junior was not invited because he did not bring a dark suit to europe.\n\nspk_0 : What I only knew someone with money that would be helpful, maybe get\n\nspk_1 : one, you know, is a sort of barrier. Teo, you know, fucking my wife,\n\nspk_2 : right? So two things. So you're an old man who is clearly a perv. Yeah, you think your son's wife is hot?\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, you've declared it.\n\nspk_2 : You go out dinner to dinner and dancing with her a bunch of times\n\nspk_1 : a bunch\n\nspk_2 : of times. Yeah, it was going on while you're in paris, ok,\n\nspk_0 : I was right about how your son to\n\nspk_2 : stay home, because he doesn't have the right suit, and your wife is cool with that there's. No way they weren't. Fuck it.\n\nspk_1 : Uh, no. Well, okay. It's. Awful. So, paul, that price so damaged. He was like my fault for not bringing a dark suit. Stupid get it. He has every right to have sex with my wife. I brought\n\nspk_0 : it on myself. All right, this is my doing. Why didn't I bring my white suit? Another classic pickle i've put myself into.\n\nspk_2 : So paul decided the middle east was no place for the young family, and they said, junior instead to run getty oil, their their branch in italy. So junior had no management experience at all, but he went anyway and took the job. Paul moved to england because he was living in so he's living in italy, and he sends his son and new family to italy, and then he moves to england, right? Okay, they bought it twenty seven bedroom house outside of london. It was reportedly haunted by the ghost of an boylan\n\nspk_1 : booklet. Wow, that's, a serious, haunting, oh, yeah, there's, a serie list, that's, a little fucking a list ambulance. They're like, oh, god, you again, no,\n\nspk_0 : oh,\n\nspk_1 : no, no, no,\n\nspk_0 : thank you, no, no, no, no,\n\nspk_1 : no, no, no, no,\n\nspk_0 : back in\n\nspk_2 : now, call he would just be trying to sleep\n\nspk_1 : jesus and and and stop doing a shitty english impression and\n\nspk_0 : stop it and stop it. Oh my god, oh my god, what, and go away, stop it! God damn it! I'm trying to sleep, shut up, baxam porridge, what you can't, i'm not\n\nspk_1 : no, you can't make ghost porridge. We've been over this. We've been over this for the last nine evenings. Now shut up and get out of here,\n\nspk_0 : god damn it, shut up!\n\nspk_1 : And twenty seven bedroom luxury, my ass and bolin's and every one of them.\n\nspk_0 : Happy national good, what are you talking about? First of all, I don't even like arsenal shut u let's, stop, stop it, stop it, stop it!\n\nspk_1 : I know what\n\nspk_0 : you're doing, you're making small talk, and then\n\nspk_1 : you're gonna go into a long, winding monologue. Now, shut up! I'm going to bed and bolin.\n\nspk_0 : Bangers and mash. Oh, my god! It's, like\n\nspk_1 : you have ghost amnesia and are doing an impression. So\n\nspk_2 : paul was also very cheap.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, it sounds like it,\n\nspk_2 : because why not? If you're the richest man in the world, will not be cheap. He reused envelopes and rubber bands\n\nspk_1 : like that, you're going to say rubbers, I was going to say that's, normal for the time. Wait, he\n\nspk_0 : reused rubber bands. Yeah, so what? That I was\n\nspk_2 : very common, because robert very\n\nspk_0 : common. Now, is it not? The fuck you who's going out, buying rubber beds. They're giving them away everywhere. All right? If you're going on buying rubber bands, you're living in a different economy. Fuck you going to staple, spreading a buck, thirty nine and eighty rubber bands. All right, what? All right, but so the embargo, anywhere that sells anything, look, give me a handful. I'll send you\n\nspk_1 : some for god's sake.\n\nspk_0 : I have a million. We didn't have a chance with that.\n\nspk_1 : No, no!\n\nspk_2 : He wouldn't turn on the heaters in the house and instead use small electric heaters. Okay. After he realized that guests were making expensive long distance phone calls from the house installed a payphone.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, my god, that that\n\nspk_1 : is dynamite that's, how you do it, that's. Awesome\n\nspk_2 : hey did have solid gold water taps in his bathroom,\n\nspk_1 : sure, and a pay phone because\n\nspk_2 : he believed gold killed bacteria. Sure,\n\nspk_1 : well, listen, a fortune teller told them, right.\n\nspk_2 : Andi had expensive art. He had a chagall above his bed and in front of it, a monet hey had a one hundred thousand dollars alarm system, and at night a guard would walk from one door to another, back and forth. What,\n\nspk_1 : like buckingham palace style,\n\nspk_2 : if he didn't get to the next door in thirty seconds on alarm would go off\n\nspk_1 : what he had. That guard was like it's, literally as bad as a job can be. He's like\n\nspk_2 : this is worse than an amazon. Yeah. A barbed wire fence around the house, and they were up to fifteen guard dogs,\n\nspk_0 : cool, so it's, like an\n\nspk_1 : inviting vibe.\n\nspk_2 : The guard dogs were vicious. They were trained to be\n\nspk_1 : fair. They have seen what they're not supposed to be like,\n\nspk_2 : you know, that's, what's, be nice,\n\nspk_1 : yeah, and that's, just like he smells my guard dog sort of vibe. There's supposed to be, like, missed, go ahead,\n\nspk_2 : so they were vicious, trained to kill and turned loose in the house at night.\n\nspk_0 : What turned loose in the house for has come for a comedic set piece. Guess\n\nspk_2 : that it would not be able to leave their room\n\nspk_0 : and to be, I just want to make a long distance phone call.\n\nspk_2 : Now junior is living in rome, and he hates his job. Getty oil by nineteen sixty two, junior and gale had four kids. Okay, well, they hung with celebrities and partied every night, okay, they tried to have an open marriage, homeboy in still. Instead, gail fell in love with lang jeffrey's, an american actor. They always have\n\nspk_1 : seems to be how they work. Yeah, exactly, yeah, you crack the door and then it's open.\n\nspk_0 : I want to fuck other people.\n\nspk_2 : I really want to fuck this other person.\n\nspk_1 : I'm in love with this other person, and we're not fucking other people, but the\n\nspk_2 : whole should've made me come what, so? That's. A fair that's, an aerosmith song.\n\nspk_1 : In a way, it was an aerosmith life.\n\nspk_2 : S o gail and junior split, they moved into separate homes, but they did not officially divorce.\n\nspk_1 : Cool. So they had a open divorce. Yeah, yeah, wide open divorce now,\n\nspk_2 : their son, little paul. He didn't see much of his mom until he was around ten. So let's, just keep that,\n\nspk_1 : yeah, it's, great it's,\n\nspk_2 : never stop that cycle now, let's, keep the\n\nspk_1 : have you thought about therapy? We don't meet therapist. We have fortune tellers very accurate, you know, I live with ambulance. And I was a pretty big deal in room back in the day, had to time name drop, but\n\nspk_0 : many a man was a little afraid of this guy\n\nspk_1 : on any whose will be. It takes times that's, right? It takes times, and you can call anywhere. Just hit nine, and you're out that's as easy as pie. Don't call it night. There are\n\nspk_0 : rabid animals\n\nspk_1 : in the halls,\n\nspk_0 : unless your wife\n\nspk_1 : wants to leave the room. That's okay?\n\nspk_0 : Bread pudding.\n\nspk_1 : I didn't say anything.

Do\n\nspk_1 : you have an open thing going on?\n\nspk_0 : Yes.\n\nspk_1 : Well, then, maybe later tonight, come to the room, and I could try to push away a couple times.\n\nspk_0 : The gunners put stuff in.

Oh, my god.\n\nspk_0 : Paul\n\nspk_2 : s so strangely paul did not do well in school.\n\nspk_1 : What do you think? It was based on neglect?\n\nspk_2 : No. At the end of one school year, he sprinkled kerosene in the school boiler room, around the entrance, on blackboards and on all the furniture.\n\nspk_0 : That's a\n\nspk_1 : fun little goof. Little end of the year pranks. Ypu.\n\nspk_0 : Then he lit it well, it's\n\nspk_1 : getting a little darker. And\n\nspk_2 : then he went to the boarding master and said, quote, strange. I think I smell burning\n\nspk_0 : well, he said, I smell burning\n\nspk_1 : oh, boy. So\n\nspk_2 : he was expelled for some reason anyway. He's a normal child.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah. Now, any kid who gets expelled for burning down the school is I mean, it's a problem child. I've always said that\n\nspk_2 : at his next school, little paul thought all the other kids were stupid. He didn't drink or play sports, and his grades were bad in nineteen sixty five, junior and gail finally divorced. Hey, galen lang bought a house in tuscany and they married while junior married on actress name talita toledo. Ok, lolita. She wore a mink trimmed bridal miniskirts.\n\nspk_0 : May shrimp bridal mini skirt\n\nspk_1 : sounds like a pikey marriage.\n\nspk_2 : Uh, you're not gonna believe this, but paul did not go to the wedding.\n\nspk_0 : What? No. Dependable paul.\n\nspk_2 : Instead, he sent a metric mistress in his place. He okay, junior dove into the hippy lifestyle and starting doing drugs.\n\nspk_1 : Nice, of course, this was bound to happen\n\nspk_2 : with his new wife. Yeah, he spent less and less time doing his job at getty oil. Ah, paul's latest, mitch, mistress, the duchess of argyle. What? Look, this is bat shit crazy.\n\nspk_1 : Okay? The duchess of argyle. Okay.\n\nspk_2 : She told them she heard jr was doing heroin. Okay? And paul broke off all relations until junior promised to quit doing heroin. That's how you\n\nspk_1 : do it right away,\n\nspk_2 : for sure. Junior refused and instead quit his job at getty oil.\n\nspk_1 : Well, yeah, at this point, if he's cutting people out of his life, it's for selfish reasons and he's creating the conditions. Well,\n\nspk_2 : he also got one hundred thousand dollars a year from the getty trust, so he really didn't fucking eat a job, right? Junior bought a house in marrakech. We should. The time was a big hippie hot spot. All kinds of guests came by and visited like mick jagger, gar vidal and prince data. Rispoli. Rispoli? Sure. Who fucking cares?\n\nspk_1 : Not you.\n\nspk_2 : But the housekeeper later said everyone was on opium and they'd like to have a grand finale at every party they held.\n\nspk_1 : They likes to have a grand\n\nspk_0 : finale. Yeah.\n\nspk_2 : You want to hear one? Well, quote, I remember once they got an american film star to screw his sister.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, my god. What just happened? What? That's. A grand finale that is a grand finale. Oh,\n\nspk_2 : my god, god, I wonder who wass\n\nspk_1 : I had to be one of the ark. Two of the are cats is my guess, and we're just spitballing.\n\nspk_2 : One, she said. Everyone was screwing everyone. Junior was having an affair. Talita had a son. They had a bit that they had a boy, and they named him tera gabriel galaxy gramophone getty\n\nspk_0 : brought to you by\n\nspk_1 : opium. That's. A great name is it it's, a great name that is a great and if\n\nspk_0 : a view of galaxy in your name\n\nspk_1 : it's. Not bad, it's, not the craziest part. You've got a really good name, that's, what you got there, you got a good name right there.\n\nspk_2 : It's a little. Paul visited his dad when he was eleven, and then he started acting like a hippy. Okay, wow, he grew his hair long. He and his dad became closer. Uh, stay at the house and he party with roger moore, the stones, she's jane and peter fonda. So he's, just a normal eleven year old kid.\n\nspk_1 : Wait, hoodie, party without the end,\n\nspk_2 : peter and peter, I know jane and peter fonda. I know, I know,\n\nspk_1 : I know just me. I know, I know. I just know what sweeps is like in this household. I\n\nspk_2 : know. Yeah, I know. I thought the same thing, okay. Oh, god, let it be true. Junior and talita became addicted to heroin, okay, jesus. So then she left and went to london to sober up\n\nspk_1 : that's, the place to go. Somewhere nice and quiet. Where drug use has gotten it down. That's. Right?\n\nspk_2 : By nineteen. Seventy, talita had almost kicked heroin, she's pretty much off I simpson on methadone or whatever. She had moved on from junior and become friendly with paul. So she's got a relationship, you know? We don't know. We don't know. It could no way do no. Anyway, she asked junior for a divorce. Well,\n\nspk_1 : that seems to be tradition.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, and he asked her to come to rome so they could discuss things. Who said if you still loved her, right? She agreed to go down there. She died of a heroin overdose that night in his apartment. Okay, junior refused to tell anyone what had happened, and he ran off to thailand and said he was looking for toledo's ghost. Oh,\n\nspk_1 : my god, what is going on? Which is how you handle death? What? Every relative that I\n\nspk_2 : have had die. I've gone to southeast asia.\n\nspk_0 : I just wish I had access\n\nspk_1 : to a ghost that I could take with me to try to find a\n\nspk_2 : ghost. I found my grandma in in in laos. And my grandfather was in camp of chia interesting, which is now now known as cambodia. But at the time, it was kampuchea.\n\nspk_1 : Congrats, that's! Awesome! Yeah! Good scifi ancestry. Just life man not necessarily know a lot of it's after realizing that maybe the beach I don't want to go any further than this one, ever say what it's about that's, what it's about? Okay, I wanted to take an ballin on an adventure through somebody's\n\nspk_2 : seen, have you seen platoon? Yeah, i've seen these movies, a lot of ghosts in that. What we had to slow it down, slow it down, played plaited twenty five percent think you're\n\nspk_1 : thinking of three men and a baby that's, right? We're little kid hangs out in the world where you don't know what i'm talking about.\n\nspk_2 : I always get I always get steve guttenberg confused with ghosts. So he comes back from thailand. I don't if you found the ghost or not, but,\n\nspk_1 : well, he's not telling people whose wife died, so surely that information's top secret as well.\n\nspk_2 : So he what they know she's dead, they just don't know how and how he wouldn't say it, anybody, how it happened, sure, i's clearly he you know, so he starts doing even more drugs, and then in italy he was supposed to buy off the corner and he forgot to pay him. Uh, so then there was a long delay, and then after a while the corners like, well, if you're not going to fucking pay me off, i'm going to do an inquiry. So then\n\nspk_1 : the good corner I\n\nspk_0 : feel like that hasn't\n\nspk_1 : changed in italy now, that seems to be the same. Yeah,\n\nspk_2 : s o, as soon as the sun is, the inquiry was called, he fled to london. Okay, now little paul is grief stricken because he loved his step mom. He developed an issue where is right. I would roll up into his head.\n\nspk_1 : He suffers from sarcasm. And we're hoping it doesn't spread to both of us. He will never be taken seriously again if that happens.\n\nspk_2 : So gail decided to take him to los angeles for an exam.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, take him to the vein, a city on the planet at this weird I\n\nspk_2 : when she found the top doctor for I guess I rolls back in head, or\n\nspk_1 : i'm the only name in the eye rolling back of the head business. Have you tried looking down, boy, this is preliminary,\n\nspk_2 : so the doctor said there was nothing physically wrong with a little paul. So he's got a psycho somatic I roll. Yeah,\n\nspk_0 : I mean, talk about damage.\n\nspk_2 : So gayle blame jr, because he was, you know, she said he was rejecting him, and out sprang up time with him,\n\nspk_1 : right? What\n\nspk_0 : you need is a montage than his. I'll\n\nspk_1 : enroll that's, such a hollywood inside joke, that's. I feel like people know the montages are, and she doesn't feel like it. But I thought\n\nspk_2 : on june nineteen, seventy one, at fourteen, little paul was expelled from school. Okay, the fires that's when he tried pot for the first time. Okay, quote, I saw the light. It was better than my first woman. I felt like hot shit\n\nspk_1 : wow! I haven't started. Think me and him and fourteen could hang out. Okay,\n\nspk_2 : he started visiting his father. They watch movies and smoke pot together. Okay, it's, nice, nice, just a dad in his fourteen year old\n\nspk_1 : getting high. Well, you gotta learn puff, puff pass from someone man that's,\n\nspk_2 : right? Little paul started dealing weed coo\n\nspk_0 : coo cool lending, shaping a pretty great over here, and he had quite the\n\nspk_2 : connection's hey sold to elton john charles bronson,\n\nspk_0 : charles bronson. What a nerve wracking pot deal experience that must\n\nspk_1 : be, hey, i'm here to give, ah, dime bag charlie b. I\n\nspk_0 : didn't. That case, charles broads, and how old is he at this point\n\nspk_2 : is for fifteen\n\nspk_0 : fifteen, charles bronson's, like,\n\nspk_1 : yeah, bye q, p s offer this kid he can't drive,\n\nspk_0 : he runs it over.\n\nspk_2 : They sell it to a bunch of celebrities being not going to school, right?\n\nspk_0 : Why would you go to school if you're charles broads, it's, pot dealer, you will go nowhere higher. You were at the apex,\n\nspk_2 : yeah. So one day, junior's, mistress victoria,\n\nspk_0 : i'm losing a little track of\n\nspk_1 : some of these people. At this point. They're really stacking up. Just\n\nspk_2 : know that junior has mrs, and paul has mistresses. She gave little paul two lines of coke\n\nspk_1 : goods, good, right age, for sure,\n\nspk_2 : she would later say, that it was actually irresponsible of her.\n\nspk_0 : Well, that's, that's,\n\nspk_1 : brave. I think we can all agree that's, pretty brave. Yeah, that might have been bad, because his mind's still developing.\n\nspk_2 : Another day, they did coke together and went saw a clockwork orange.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, my god, what what a horrible decision! Is there a worse movie to see on cocaine for the first time? Hey, what's this about fruit, but you talk it. Animated fruit on a deadline. Oh, my god! Oh, my fucking god! Let him close his eyes. Let us all close our eyes. Little paul loved it and went bad sign and went to see it. Twenty three more times. Damn flag. He went to see it twenty three more times. You should be on an fbi watch list for that twenty three times. Oh, my god! You left it all out there, and then\n\nspk_2 : paul little paul started doing acid. Of\n\nspk_1 : course, I mean, without question, for\n\nspk_2 : sure. One day, he had a really bad trip, and it was at home. And he went outside and fought garden statues.\n\nspk_1 : To be fair, it could have made a lot of sense. Yeah, probably did.\n\nspk_2 : I hope he won\n\nspk_1 : it's, hard to know, who's winning in those fights,\n\nspk_2 : he thought he could walk through walls and tried again and again to get back into the house, knocking himself black and blue.\n\nspk_1 : As it's. Pretty powerful.\n\nspk_2 : Now junior was home, and he said, the victoria quote,\n\nspk_0 : what do you say, there's? Something\n\nspk_2 : unpleasant going on outside. My son is on an acid trip. He's threatened the servants with an ax and he's halfway up the fucking drain pipe.\n\nspk_0 : What? Talk about trumping walking through walls, it's just threatened the staff with an act. And he's king kong in a drain pipe is jesus, no more acid at home, man. Maybe there's\n\nspk_2 : something wrong with rich people? Probably no, get that for me, daddy.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, I got your book. All right, so. After this incident, yeah, it's got a mullet, and we're in the midwest, a little business in the back for you,\n\nspk_0 : so you're so your\n\nspk_2 : son, your son has attack the garden gnomes, crawled up the\n\nspk_1 : drinking when they statues of garden gnomes, because otherwise that's really on fire, I\n\nspk_2 : assume there are gnomes.\n\nspk_0 : They'll drop like flies, so\n\nspk_2 : he's attached. The guardian's attacked, the guard climbed up the drainpipe. He tried to walk through the wall, and he threatened the servants with an axe. What do you do? That's, right, that's, right, you make him\n\nspk_1 : write an essay. You put him in literal hell.\n\nspk_2 : You make him write an essay about what he thought drugs would do for\n\nspk_1 : him. Oh, my god. And he just tries a picture of his chest without a heart. And it points to dad.\n\nspk_2 : Cool. Son, do you mind if I give this to my father? I'm just going to spell. Check this and send it on. So now paul i'm pretty sure you\n\nspk_0 : just walked through one of those walls I think you did it what happened all the gnomes so little\n\nspk_2 : paul now started going to his grandfather's house and paul was of course disappointed in junior but he thought maybe little paul could give him some faith and\n\nspk_1 : right maybe yeah being a dipshit skips a generation that's right right\n\nspk_2 : so the two gettys worked on plans for the j paul getty museum in malibu okay all right just just annoy old man and his fifteen year old grandson working on plans for a museum like I did with my dad and you did with yours\n\nspk_1 : absolutely boys sure did it really helps if you can walk through those walls too it's you can go inspect whenever\n\nspk_2 : that's right but then little paul left london to move back to rome he lived he moved in and live with his friend marcello and a studio apartment and the two fancy themselves painters and decided to be painters for the rest of life.\n\nspk_1 : Okay, so that's the end of them okay,\n\nspk_2 : well he was there a little paul rarely talked about his family's money but everyone knew it often eat by paying the owner of a nearby restaurant with a painting that's this's a good time to just hate hippies.\n\nspk_1 : Well, rich ip is ah because\n\nspk_2 : well, he was only able to pay with a painting because they knew who he wass if he was just in order to do, they wouldn't take a painting. Yeah, let's, get till the new it's a getty panting and, like it's kind of weird, something more in the two bucks for the spaghetti. Yeah,\n\nspk_1 : well, yeah, what's, the tip situation. I mean, there's a lot. You gotta tip out the busters. You talk\n\nspk_2 : about a whole system, you're tipping it's, rome. No, they they're normal there. They don't pay people money that working there\n\nspk_1 : know the way to do it. The way to do it is that have the restaurant not pay anything. And make sure that they're depend on strangers. That's. The way to create a stable business model, you jackass. Lord\n\nspk_0 : it's called capitalism so in rome a little\n\nspk_2 : paul became a minor celebrity the press called him\n\nspk_1 : wait does he become the pope yes\n\nspk_0 : I knew it\n\nspk_2 : oh but now I have to do the end now you know the end\n\nspk_1 : I love it\n\nspk_2 : the press called him the golden hippie\n\nspk_1 : nice that's a great title\n\nspk_2 : he was once arrested while protesting and got a reputation with sighting for siding with the oppressed he spoke out against the rich quote the rich are the riel pour on earth their mound nutrition is of the spirit one should pity them okay you know in london disappointed paul read that in the papers\n\nspk_1 : you sure it's like what oh my you're no son of mine\n\nspk_2 : a little paul now sixteen started seeing\n\nspk_0 : a sixteen she's a god almighty's like macaulay culkin I feel like i've been with this kid forever it's just\n\nspk_2 : he started seeing a twenty four year old german divorce a with a one year old child okay let\n\nspk_1 : me guess let me guess it was his grandpa's baby\n\nspk_0 : small world well I met\n\nspk_1 : him when I was thirteen he\n\nspk_0 : swept me off my feet\n\nspk_1 : he did a\n\nspk_0 : really seducer\n\nspk_2 : he cheated on her well the party the party discos and smoked hash and then he started doing a lot of coke okay? The area of rome a little paul lived in is where a lot of the mafia\n\nspk_1 : lived a boy\n\nspk_2 : shim balloon a was the main coke dealer little paul started asking for advances,\n\nspk_1 : advances on coke. Yeah, thats you know you're in a good spot. When you're doing that, like you're in a good area,\n\nspk_2 : he started hanging out with gangsters, and one night meant to air france pilots through them who said to him, quote, why\n\nspk_0 : don't we kidnap you? I'm sorry, air france pilot, you're cut off from cocaine for\n\nspk_1 : the rest of the night. How's that sound for pushback. You know what we should do? We should kidnap you, man. It would be so simple. Yeah, uh, ma'am, we're just\n\nspk_0 : fucking get you. Take you hostage fucking in between flights being by mood. Next they were after you throw her laugh all the way down the fucking banker. But this is good shit. I can't feel my mouth. Your mouse. Yes, this little mouse I carry around. Also, my gums are numb.\n\nspk_2 : So yes, so they said they were wish it can't happen right? A fake kidnapping and little paul said he was quote ready to do it just out of economic necessity for political reasons and wanting to buy weapons and things\n\nspk_1 : wait okay, so ah lot of boxes are checked for little paul\n\nspk_0 : here all I don't think any normal, right? I mean, I guess\n\nspk_1 : money he needs the money the other one is he meets the buy\n\nspk_0 : weapons okay? And the last one again political\n\nspk_1 : reasons okay, I think you could too. And three could combine pretty easily.\n\nspk_2 : He told his girlfriend he considered it but he had changed his mind\n\nspk_1 : once I stop doing cocaine, I realized that was not a good idea, so\n\nspk_0 : he was hanging out with\n\nspk_2 : andy warhol in mick jagger and rome.\n\nspk_0 : Why the fuck of these guys hanging\n\nspk_2 : out the sixteen year old it's just rich people drugs? He got a small part in a roman polanski film jesus christ he's hanging out with all the good ones she's just traced a woman he knew who was also connected to the mafia said\n\nspk_0 : they should fake a\n\nspk_2 : kidnapping and once and make some money\n\nspk_1 : people there keep soft suggesting this to him. Yeah, I feel like there's a little b s story going on\n\nspk_2 : well, then he started to worry\n\nspk_1 : is it me? Do I give off that vibe\n\nspk_2 : so he went to gale, and he told her he was addicted to coke. Ok, she cried. Sure, a three a. M on july tenth, nineteen, seventy three, a drunk, a little paul was walking the streets of rome in tight jeans and a t shirt with glitter on it.\n\nspk_1 : So he was walking around is the people in rome do.\n\nspk_2 : Suddenly, men grabbed him and shoved him into a car on the floor. One asked little paul, who he wass and paul, said paul getty. He immediately realized that was a mistake.\n\nspk_0 : So now the guy who has been in a couple pitches for\n\nspk_1 : fake kidnappings is getting real kidnapped and he's, not mentally gone through any steps of how he'd handle it. No paul getty. I have access to money. Upsy daisy! That seems like a big snafu early.\n\nspk_2 : The job all night stopping toe haven't get out in march in circles. Awesome, so they didn't know they couldn't there, like he won't know where he's going. But,\n\nspk_1 : you know, that's, the way to do it. No, yeah, if he's blindfolded in the back of a car e still make him go, walk in circles, disorient amoy further,\n\nspk_2 : gail got a phone call. Quote, we have your son, paul getty jonah, we have your son, paul getty. I told her not to go to the police. She called the police. Interesting, junior told gail, should have to ask paul for the money because they weren't speaking jesus christ, so awkward, yeah,\n\nspk_1 : he'll listen to you,\n\nspk_2 : scotch. So the carbonari arrived at gail's, selected carbonari it's, an italian military force that has police duties. I\n\nspk_1 : thought it was spaghetti with bacon and eggs. Yeah.\n\nspk_2 : So they questioned gail for five hours and then said, quote, we know your son, signora he's, probably with a girl or his hippie friends.\n\nspk_1 : Classic stereo. Typical italian police were right. That's. What it looks like it, yeah, he's, probably after having a phone, you\n\nspk_0 : know what i'm gonna do? Uh, he's, probably getting a meatball. Yeah, put out an a p b on possible in this way, go funny, abi, what you worried about it? Why you crying?\n\nspk_2 : She asked them to keep it out of the press. And they agreed. Twenty minutes after they left, the press called.\n\nspk_1 : I mean, of course, yeah. First first, yeah.\n\nspk_2 : Is front page news had been in their house? One headline in rome, rome. Quote, joke or kidnapped articles?\n\nspk_1 : Is that a new game show? Love to play that\n\nspk_0 : it's a joke, kid. Now, what do you guys say? Okay.\n\nspk_2 : Articles focused on little paul social life, london's daily mail wrote, quote, paul was more likely to be in the hands of a bewitching french woman than ransom seeking gangsters, according to his hippie friends. Fall is fall in love with Daniel de brett, a 25 year old blond gogo dancer with honey gold skin, and has run away with her.\n\nspk_0 : What with honey gold? What kind\n\nspk_1 : of kidnapping article is this? You got a hundred gold skin, tight type politics? What paper\n\nspk_0 : was this again? But i'm a trance from an italian reporter. And\n\nspk_1 : I work in a land that has the core is a story you got here and how they turn it into a musical.\n\nspk_2 : So gail refused to talk to the press and the press just started making shit up. One article quoted gail, I think the phone call was some sort of joke, which wasn't true at all, right? Okay, they then they dug into junior's life, a small group of mafia, the drag getthe train. Gitta had kidnapped little paul. The mafia usually didn't kidnap foreigners, but he was the grandson of the richest man of the war in the world. So paul sent an ex a cia spy. Okay, who worked for getting oil to rome to help out. Now the spy was big on conspiracy theories and was very, very confident in his abilities as a spy. A negotiator,\n\nspk_1 : no, no, and he, like, just shifted from liam niece. And just like a comedic figure in my head, I will get your son it's, that it's a guy like\n\nspk_0 : you know, you just gotta grease him up a little.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, he went straight to paul blurt.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, yeah.\n\nspk_2 : Eso, after he talked to galea, went to investigate little paul's friends. Now, little paul was trying to impress his kidnappers.\n\nspk_1 : What a weird angle telling him you juggle for\n\nspk_2 : telling him he had porsche's motorcycles and then it was worth a hundred fifty million miss. Now,\n\nspk_0 : right angle, no numbers, no feel like i'm cut off from\n\nspk_1 : my family. I'm useless to you is better.\n\nspk_2 : Ah, so that\n\nspk_1 : means they're negotiating like that. One dude in the original die hard with the beard is doing all the time because the past\n\nspk_0 : really hands, baby hans, we gap this man, i'm your guy!\n\nspk_1 : Five minutes later. Parents\n\nspk_2 : s o the kidnappers took him to an old world war two bunker in the mountain. So is a good time,\n\nspk_0 : yeah, for sherry, like, oh, cool, a layer it's going to be fine, the hue inside\n\nspk_1 : of a brick oven. Around an hour\n\nspk_2 : after ten days, gil received a note made up of letters cut from magazines.\n\nspk_1 : All right,\n\nspk_2 : they wanted ten million leering, about seventy million dollars, okay, which would be about ninety four million today. It's pretty pretty piece of change she called paul paul, would not call her back.\n\nspk_0 : What? I'm swamped. I\n\nspk_2 : got the dogs, they won't let me out of the room also, none of change for the payphone\n\nspk_1 : soups. Ijust gets back at her through telegram, soups on over, call tomorrow.\n\nspk_2 : Paul. It becomes even more terrified now that he would be kidnapped. What an\n\nspk_1 : amazing reaction. Yeah, we always worried about me, is me. What if i'm not okay?\n\nspk_2 : S o he then refused to answer the phone.\n\nspk_1 : Well, they can drag you through the phone, a\n\nspk_0 : fortune teller told may.\n\nspk_2 : He then released a statement to the press quote. I have fourteen grandchildren. And if I pay a penny of ransom, i'll have fourteen\n\nspk_1 : kidnap grandchildren. All these people, I don't negotiate for grandchildren.\n\nspk_0 : What an amazing policy.\n\nspk_1 : And then, you know, the next thing you know well, fourteen of them will be kidnapped. And guess who they're coming to? Old moneybags. I'm not falling for that one.\n\nspk_2 : I'm the richest\n\nspk_0 : man in the\n\nspk_2 : world, paul believed the kidnapping was little paul's fault for being a hippie. Okay, i'm kind of with him on this one. Of course\n\nspk_1 : you are right, no, not right, why just fucking hippies,\n\nspk_0 : they're not him.\n\nspk_2 : So on july thirtieth, gail got a call from a kidnapper, who's said to call him shin quanta, which means fifty cinquanta, okay, yale said she couldn't get the money on a furious fifty couldn't believe it.\n\nspk_0 : Quiet, a\n\nspk_1 : negotiation with money. Would you ever change your name to fifty? Just adds a layer of possible confusion. One fifty. This is fifty. What the hell's going on over here, what's happening.\n\nspk_2 : So furious, fifty, couldn't believe she couldn't get the money. Quote.\n\nspk_0 : Who is this so called a grandfather? How could he leave his own flesh and blood in the place of\n\nspk_2 : it? Sounds like a vampire,\n\nspk_1 : right, fresh air, fresh air, the vampire, absolutely way. Have your boy. He's got a very pretty name. I'll just do it fifty liters of blood, richard b five hundred and fifty liters today.\n\nspk_0 : Like all I can say, is it's, a spicy meatball,\n\nspk_2 : I can't do anything else, even that's, treacherous and chad's. Good quote, who is this so called grandfather? How could leave his own flesh and blood in the plate that your poor son is in here is the richest man in america, and you tell me he refuses to just find ten million dollars\n\nspk_0 : for his prints\n\nspk_2 : on safety, senor, you take me for a fuel, what you fool, what you say, it's, just not possible, not possible, right?\n\nspk_0 : How can I be? We love\n\nspk_2 : a family in the air to me. Yeah, the press\n\nspk_0 : really hear your family like we always a c.\n\nspk_2 : S o. The press really did not like gail and paul's. Xia guy commits gail to fake like she passed out to get sympathy from the press she's.\n\nspk_1 : But like publicly,\n\nspk_2 : so she went outside and collapsed.\n\nspk_0 : I'll take two. And they touch your big even from amelia.\n\nspk_2 : On they took her in an ambulance away to paul's house that's. Where\n\nspk_1 : the patients go, we'll take you to our local apollo's, a house.\n\nspk_2 : S o, the kidnappers move little paul to the bottom of a gorge and changed him up near a stream. He built a little hut for himself, trees, branches and plastic for a roof. He made friends with a bird freedom, feeding it crumbs.\n\nspk_1 : If you remove the chains, i'm into this and the kidnappers.\n\nspk_2 : The kidnappers gave little paul paint and paper, and he painted rocks and kept a diary. Yeah, but then the kidnappers killed his bird in front of him because they were frustrated with them.\n\nspk_0 : They're kidnappers, their bird killers. You, now you get upset.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, i'm upset now that bird did nothing new, nothing, unless it was a parent, it wasn't talking.\n\nspk_2 : So fifty started calling gale's lawyer to try to get the money.\n\nspk_1 : It's, a mere fifty. I'm a really frustrated over here. He\n\nspk_2 : just didn't get what the problem, wass. By august, the carabinieri went back to their theory that the kidnapping was a hoax. There's absolutely no evidence to corroborate this, but they hadn't found him, so why not? On august sixteenth, another letter came. Dear mother and father, I have been with my kidnappers a month. The waiting is terrible with my family pay or will I be killed? Mama and papa see that they don't kill me. I am so young, I am not even seventeen, and I sound like and I sound like i'm an italian aunt. I'm not even seventeen and never\n\nspk_0 : seventeen yet,\n\nspk_2 : no sixteen, and I say never, as in these terrible days, I have trapped to live for the rest of my life, even in misery, they similarly clearly written by an italian guy. The amount was reduced to three million, five point five million\n\nspk_1 : it's getting kind of basket.\n\nspk_2 : Totally gale's lawyer got her to appeal to the kidnappers on tv,\n\nspk_1 : and you need to faint again. Gail, we need one more\n\nspk_2 : the interviewer asked her if she thought little paul was dead and gail face\n\nspk_0 : no, no.\n\nspk_1 : Oh, boy! Okay.\n\nspk_2 : Fifty and seen it. And he called her and assured her that paul was alive. She asked questions on ly. Little paul would know, and fifty told her the answers, so she knew he was alive, right? Okay, um so they started talking a lot fifty. And gail, you would call. They talk\n\nspk_1 : what? Are you is this like a sleepless in seattle, so no, they're just friends, yeah, huh?\n\nspk_2 : He told her he had a wife and kids.\n\nspk_1 : Oh, yeah, that matters in this world we've created,\n\nspk_2 : she asked him how he could be a kidnapper, and he said, quote, singer it's, like a job like any other,\n\nspk_1 : you know, it doesn't define me. I mean, i'm a very complicated underneath it all. I like to dance. Had I take a poetry class when i'm about the kidnapping, you have a salt river issue over here.\n\nspk_0 : Female government.\n\nspk_1 : Where are you from? I don't know. But give me another round. The youth. God, is this crazy or water? Just crazy. Oh, no, this happens every now and then i've become a true lt is, oh, no, there must be a full moon. So that is, I look outside, then, you know, there is a no, no, it's happened in, uh oh, my god, it's like, wow, like, how could this even happen? Whoa! We'll know. Starts to grow hair on his head.\n\nspk_0 : Oh, no, so fifty said\n\nspk_2 : his accomplices were becoming impatient, and in august twenty third, a letter from little paul was published in a newspaper. Dear mother and father, I beg you to pay to not have me killed. I have a great desire to live. I would never have believed that you don't care about me. I am also sick and have fever. My grandfather, please, please pay the money. The ex cia agents started banging a girl he met in his hotel.\n\nspk_1 : Well, that's, an interesting wrinkle that the case\n\nspk_2 : turns out. She worked for the mafia was trying to find out what he knew.\n\nspk_1 : Oh, no, no.\n\nspk_2 : But all he told her is that he was starting to believe it was a hoax, which he reported back to paul. The ex cia agent convinced gail to goto london, london, saying it would confuse the kidnappers. What's this advice because he thinks it's a hoax. Yeah, but terrible advice, because they could easily kill guilted. She went to junior, who refused to talk about his kidnapped son and then yelled at her that she did not have an appointment.\n\nspk_0 : What? Shit. Rich people are so awful\n\nspk_1 : and also make an appointment. Next time\n\nspk_0 : I have a twelve thirty,\n\nspk_2 : paul said. He wouldn't see her. Sorry, paul wouldn't see her saying everything had to go through the ex cia agent who knew nothing. Meanwhile, the ex cia agent would only set up super secret meetings with gail and parks. And he promised her he was telling all over messages to paul way saying it's insane, it's insane. Everything is insane, it's all completely insane.\n\nspk_1 : So he will only meet her publicly in a party. What if she tells him stuff that he's says he's telling the paul right and he's not right for you and your wants an appointment, right? And the other kid lives in a hole with a bird that got killed. That's. Right.\n\nspk_2 : So in italy, it was getting very cold. So the kidnappers moved further down the mountain once said, quote to paul, please try to escape. We can use that as an excuse to kill you. You fucking little rich smut, mixed signals. They put him in a big cave and said he was getting too comfortable. So a quote, main man was going to come. What? He was getting too comfortable. Okay, so the main man came and he spent five nights trying to scare little paul. How way? South american. And he spent days loading and reloading his pistol, cleaning it and making noises to try to scare a little paul. He gave little paul very little water and pushed him around. And after a while, little paul told the kidnappers their plan was ridiculous. And the man should just leave.\n\nspk_1 : Nice. The man left. Oh, my god, he did. Okay.\n\nspk_2 : A second south american man came.\n\nspk_1 : I not as mean\n\nspk_2 : at night. He made so much noise that little paul couldn't sleep, and finally, a little paul thought with him, ok, I was the end of that guy. What guess they got rid of him, too. On october fifth, another letter was published in the paper, but this one was from the kidnappers. The getty family has fifteen days to find the money for paul's. Release at the end of this period may be it will be yourself who will open the letter containing an ear with a lock of hair from paul, after which you\n\nspk_1 : don't both that's\n\nspk_2 : true, after which they don't. If they don't hurry up and bring the money, paul will be killed. Okay, so the kidnappers move little paul to a house, eyes it. He was\n\nspk_1 : just getting like better accommodations slowly but surely\n\nspk_2 : he was sharing a room with chickens.\n\nspk_1 : I stand by what I said.\n\nspk_2 : Fifty told gail the men were planning something drastic, and she should come see little paul, and she agreed, okay, but just before she was about to leave, the cia agent talked her out of going. The kidnappers were furious, fifty, screamed at her over the phone and told her, whatever happened, a little paul next wasn't his fault. He had tried the deadline the kidnappers had set arrived. They decided to cut off his ear with scissors, but kept putting it off all day. Of course, they gave him a new radio, and washington disinfected his ear, but still didn't do it.\n\nspk_1 : So he just got a clean ear. Can you threaten to cut off the other one? So they just look the\n\nspk_2 : same at four a. M, they cooked for steaks, for little paul to quote, help him\n\nspk_0 : what these guys are really softies. They have to bring in outside meanness. They can't help\n\nspk_2 : themselves. It was about a little meat. Sorry,\n\nspk_1 : we just got a few years earlier, four sticks, huh?\n\nspk_2 : Who's, a big man. Paul ate all the steaks. They then ask paul. If you want to hold off for a few more days and pulse it, just get it over with.\n\nspk_0 : What he's, the one is like. Cut my ear off.\n\nspk_2 : So they got him drunk and it's. Seven a. M told little paul the blindfold himself, and sit on a chopping block that was used to butcher pigs.\n\nspk_0 : He sits on a chopping.\n\nspk_2 : Yep. He stuffed the handkerchief in his mouth. Little paul asked if it was going to hurt. And the kidnappers said, quote, of course, it's. Going to hurt. Yes, it is your era, which is also close to our currency. Yeah. Little paul said, do it quickly.\n\nspk_0 : It's, that's. Probably mountain option ready. No, why you standing up?\n\nspk_2 : He felt the razor and heard, quote, a sound like ripping paper. Okay, he felt no pain until alcohol was applied. This here was gone, they said. He was very brave, bandaged him and took polaroids.\n\nspk_1 : We want to make sure we got it it's pretending\n\nspk_2 : to waive the polaroid and blowing on it. The people at home,\n\nspk_1 : i'm going to write us something goofy on it\n\nspk_0 : here. I don't know. I can't. I can't\n\nspk_2 : hear you. In the year kept bleeding or what was left of the stuff. They do that here, little paul light head he laid down and he's in pain, and very which side to delay on, probably other one. Okay, the game, a tetanus shot and a shot of penicillin, she said. Men mohr, penicillin shot on dh, then mohr, and it turns out, if you give someone too much penicillin, it makes them allergic to penicillin. Who paul was now allergic to penicillin. Okay, seventeen hours later, he was still bleeding. There was blood in his hair down his back, and all over his body. Rats started to eat the blood and his\n\nspk_1 : bandages. Oh, uh,\n\nspk_2 : that's. My least favorite thing that's ever happened on this podcast.\n\nspk_1 : Such a win for the rats, though. There, oh, my god,\n\nspk_0 : yeah, no! Fuck! Uh\n\nspk_2 : he started to vomit and scream after a day and a half. That gave him a coagulant shot, which helped. By the third day, he regained enough strength than consciousness to eat. They did not change the bandage, because they would have had teo ripped it off, which would pull off the scab. And the bleeding would start all over again and then. Then comes the rats. And the whole, the cycle\n\nspk_1 : things. Cycle of the rats, the circa.\n\nspk_2 : Fifty calls gail to tell me what they had done. S o. We cut off in here,\n\nspk_0 : how you have been. Yeah, the kids\n\nspk_2 : are good, my kids a good, good, and I think it's, a fine in the house, so gail did not believe him.\n\nspk_0 : Put him on the phone. No,\n\nspk_2 : we only have the right to side of phone and get\n\nspk_1 : a blood on it.\n\nspk_2 : So she didn't believe him. So, he said. He said he would send the ear and photographs. Several polaroids were found in a trash can in rome. They were of an emaciated little paul, with just one ear. Fifty called gail a few times to ask if she had received the ear, but she had not.\n\nspk_1 : I mean of it's awful, but of all things to be lost in the mail, when you, like, was\n\nspk_0 : the tracking a number, um, boy\n\nspk_2 : again, or the adjust it's around here somewhere. He didn't believe her. He asked if the getty family had bought the illa messaggero paper to hide the truth. Turns out, the kidnappers have sent the year. On october twentieth, there was a postal strike.\n\nspk_1 : So, justin somewhere house. So dripping song, lope of ear.\n\nspk_2 : So italian. So it arrived twenty eight days\n\nspk_1 : later. No, I got some pictures in jerky. I didn't get a near.\n\nspk_2 : He was sent to the newspaper and a secretary open the package and fainted. Okay, then police came and got the ear and brought it to gail, so she could idea\n\nspk_1 : what's. Did they do the whole, like, ma'am, is that the year\n\nspk_2 : know they had for ears lined up? A couple. A couple of cops are like, I don't think this is worth it, uh,\n\nspk_1 : well, his ear wasn't five inches, three centimetres tall,\n\nspk_0 : that's an elephant\n\nspk_2 : here, boys, she's a good. Gail idea, dear as little paul's.\n\nspk_1 : The one that's the year\n\nspk_0 : that's, my boy,\n\nspk_2 : do it shape and freckles. Junior still refused to pay the ransom when he heard about gail's. Ear I d, he said, quote, she would know the difference between an heir and a piece of prosciutto.\n\nspk_0 : I don't think a lot of\n\nspk_1 : us would after twenty eight days.\n\nspk_2 : That's. What? Paul's, that's! What little paul's like, I should never set him that best. Dad! Mug. Yeah! Gail sent poster sized images of the ear to paul and junior.\n\nspk_1 : Happy holidays. Jerk off to this. Well, as you do with most christmas guards, she\n\nspk_2 : also contacted president nixon, who knew paul well, and the u s assigned an italian who worked in the u s embassy to the case. He contacted the kidnappers and got the ransom reduced from ah, fuck I this three million from from american, but it's it's, seventeen, down to three million americans taken less. Okay, right. But the year changed everything paul and junior finally gave in. Paul agreed to pay two point two million of the ransom. Junior would have to pay the rest, which paul it give him as alone at four percent interest. Wow! Softy. Yeah, those are just those air, just minnesota values right there. Coming out, she's. This paul paid two point two million, because that was the amount that was tax deductible.\n\nspk_1 : Wow, wow! So what do you write off this year? Well, anier.\n\nspk_2 : The ex cia agents plan was to talk the kidnappers to the kidnappers himself. Now the\n\nspk_1 : kidnappers that he didn't believe we're at anyone. Now, he's, like i'm in charge negotiation.\n\nspk_2 : He took the next phone call, but he didn't speak italian, and he tried to speak spanish.\n\nspk_1 : Wow, that\n\nspk_2 : just pissed off fifty who thought the gettys. We're not taking the kidnapping serious. Jesus\n\nspk_0 : christ, how I mean, that's, rudimentary. Take us to basketball. Yo, soy yo tortuga! Nobody.\n\nspk_2 : Despite fifties and since in insistence that gale drop off the money, this ex cia agent decided to do\n\nspk_1 : it himself. Course, yep, for sure, he's the guy,\n\nspk_2 : but there was a snowstorm on the road and then fog the drop, and he could not low cat locate the kidnappers for the drop. So so he went back,\n\nspk_1 : so I went back, okay, I was curious what, how he would handle that,\n\nspk_2 : fifty was livid, but he gave them one more chance to try again. The ex cia agent made the drop on december twelve, and that was it. Little paul was given blankets, a pack of cigarettes and new clothes,\n\nspk_1 : and the bird\n\nspk_2 : and no, the kidnappers believed a man returning home should be dressed well. That's. Why\n\nspk_0 : the without a fucking ear,\n\nspk_1 : you are clean, open ass,\n\nspk_2 : put a beret and leading\n\nspk_0 : it off around. Get off. A\n\nspk_1 : radha reds is still picking up here.\n\nspk_2 : So they dropped him in. Paul started walking. He saw a gas station payphone, but he had no money.\n\nspk_1 : That's, like the one we have a home.\n\nspk_2 : Hey, ask to borrow money from a soldier that was there, but the soldiers said no\n\nspk_1 : that's, not how this normally works.\n\nspk_2 : Little paul then went into the gas station and ask people for money, and they just stared at him and didn't give him any.\n\nspk_1 : I have a ferrari,\n\nspk_2 : he walked on. Finally, he just laid down in the middle of the freeway, what's and a truck drivers stopped little. Paul told him his name and the gyros said, quote, you are, aren't you? And then he drove off.\n\nspk_1 : I'm not getting any easier promises that cave about now.\n\nspk_2 : A captain in the local carabinieri gotta report at two forty five a m of a boy walking around he jovan picked him up. It was little paul gail came down, and when she arrived, she saw her son, filthy, skinny, barely able to walk and head covered with a bloodied bandage. She took him back to rome. Media surrounded the car, taking photos and cheering helicopters followed. Doctors told paul he could get plastic surgery to rebuild his ear. It was paul's eighty first birthday. Wow, how about that for a birthday present? Yeah, gale told little paul to call his grandfather to thank him, paul refused to take the call.\n\nspk_1 : Wow. Consistent, consistent, consistent.\n\nspk_2 : Our minnesota is known for just holding grudges. Little paul spent three days in recovery, and then the family left free two months vacation in austria. I\n\nspk_1 : came back. You go, okay?\n\nspk_2 : He came back, and he visited his father in london. They did not talk, but just watched movies and ate little. Paul said he wanted to make films, and junior said he wanted to make porno sze. It is a classic father son moment. Dad, I want to make movies.\n\nspk_1 : I want a big fuck movies.\n\nspk_2 : Junior finally said\n\nspk_0 : he thought, what an amazing answer.\n\nspk_1 : I want to make a porno. So we all have things we want, son. So you want that air back? I want to make movies. I said, i'm sure you want that ear back. I'm gonna turn around what? I want to make fuck movies like you want your ear.\n\nspk_2 : I wish I hadn't turned around.\n\nspk_1 : Agree. It took too long.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, that was a bummer.\n\nspk_1 : I didn't say that to say it again. It's like confession. Jew, he fell. That guy's, that\n\nspk_2 : guy's upset you, said confession, the place that would be raided by the fbi if it wasn't a church. No. No. Does so? Junior finally said he thought the kidnapping was a hoax, and he was angry to have to pay sixty thousand a month to repay his father. Wow, little paul left the next day in the summer of nineteen seventy four, his german girlfriend, who's. She was still with right. She found out she was pregnant and little paul married or okay, so someone, finally,\n\nspk_1 : it's better than saying disgusting. But this meant\n\nspk_2 : that he forfeited any money from the getty trust, one because it had been written in that any child who married before he was twenty two would not get money. This was to avoid the kids who are taking advantage of,\n\nspk_0 : oh, my god.\n\nspk_1 : So in sorry. In this world, you're allowed to marry a seventeen year old, but you are not allowed as a male to marry over, or\n\nspk_2 : or female either one,\n\nspk_1 : right? But you still can't marry over twenty two, because you're not mature enough\n\nspk_2 : under twenty two, any any getty cannot marry under twenty two, where they do not get the trust.\n\nspk_1 : And yet every get he wants to marry under twenty two.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, but that's, just hot. Mmm. Paul also. Then dis inherited little paul. Jesus hey, hadn't been through enough\n\nspk_1 : now, right? Yeah,\n\nspk_2 : so little paul and martine that's, his german lady, moved to l a. He was now completely addicted to heroin. They had a son about his arm. Yes,\n\nspk_1 : tests on heroin. During the naming ceremony,\n\nspk_2 : paul sort of wandered through life, addicted to drugs, trying to find a purpose. The ransom money was never found. Seven men were caught and tried in nineteen seventy five. Those found guilty, sir, between four and eleven years. In nineteen, seventy seven, a little paul underwent plastic surgery in los angeles to replace the ear. Paul is worried because there was no one to take over his empire. In his eighties, he was taking a tch three, a sex drug to help him get hard jesus. At eighty three, he got a face, a third face lift, which did not take, and he ended up looking much older than normal. No,\n\nspk_1 : yes, sure, that's. How his dick looked hard.\n\nspk_2 : He changed his will constantly. He died on june sixth, nineteen, seventy six. He was worth one billion, which is four point three billion today. Thie majority went to the j paul getty museum in malibu, but all the kids got million's not a lot, but millions. Paul is an alcoholic. His maternal grandfather filed a lawsuit and became his legal guardian. Once, little paul tried to draw himself off lock island, but mick jagger saved him, and why?\n\nspk_0 : Okay, bye. Mick jagger's, a there, treated like a bird bar. I\n\nspk_2 : mean, housing on the mick jagger biopic. Just from this thing alone, you gotta be so fucking he fucked. David bowie like it's, all great, yeah, that's. The best he's, the best story ever\n\nspk_1 : on april fifth. Nice save your drug dealer,\n\nspk_2 : for sure. On april fifth, nineteen, eighty one, a cocktail of drugs caused little paws liver to fail. He went into a coma. He woke two months later. He was now a quadriplegic when his grandmother and saw him for the first time, she said, quote, they should have put him down to end his misery.\n\nspk_0 : Just no greater it, he's,\n\nspk_1 : not good. At greetings and\n\nspk_2 : again, he's, there are good humans. Gail sued junior to get help with medical expenses. Junior was then shamed, gave in and became even more of ah, rick loose it's complicated, but getty oil was sold, and there was fighting and lawsuits. Junior ended up being the sixth richest man in britain. He got super into terrible causes and art, and in march nineteen, eighty six, junior and little paul were reunited in london. Junior was made in an honorary knight of the british empire for services to the arts. Wow! I mean, wine, that guy.\n\nspk_1 : What, really? A knight? Sounds like he's here tonight.\n\nspk_2 : In nineteen ninety three, paula martine divorced. Paul regularly visited with his son, baltazar, now an actor in los angeles. Yeah. Yeah, I just figured it\n\nspk_1 : out. Yeah, i'm warning you okay in there,\n\nspk_2 : little paul and gail moved to ireland in in nineteen ninety nine. He and six members of his family became citizens of the irish republic in return for investments, a process which was then abolished. So they just paid, like a shitload of money, become citizens of ireland, right? Because they're that low tax rate, right can she would want to pay taxes on your fucking gobs of money? No junior died at the age of seventy in two thousand three and left the bulk of his fortune to hundred million pounds to a different sun and left paul. Fifty thousand pounds little power. Little paul died. Little. Paul died in his mansion in buckinghamshire, england, in two thousand eleven at the age of fifty four. In a people magazine interview, balthasar once said, quote, there's, something called the bread of shame. And that is when you get money or things you didn't earn, that is my rich kids, for the most part, are fucked up. They end up in rehab. Are we see them on tv, making all these bad life choices. One way you can counteract that is if you give a lot. That is the way we have raised our children, or give it all away and have your children tried it, make it on their own. That's my suggestion to the gettys because they shouldn't have money\n\nspk_1 : or children, right? You know what about tying that shit off? But on some pig's stomach every now and then. Get\n\nspk_2 : it in two thousand fourteen, forms like the getty family, at about five billion dollars, that made in the fifty fourth wealthiest family in the country, sits fairly well. That is the story. Minneapolis is most successful citizen.\n\nspk_0 : Jesus christ. They seemed chill. Celtic\n\nspk_2 : there are times I think, being that rich makes you you have a mental disorder.\n\nspk_1 : Well, I think that's, why it's good to create more people like that and get them into political office. Yet\n\nspk_2 : that was the point way would like to get all get he's elected to office. Yeah, I think that's. The best thing we can do right\n\nspk_1 : now, create a getty class it's,\n\nspk_0 : almost like\n\nspk_2 : if you take a really bad person and make them rich, that they don't get better, they get worse.\n\nspk_1 : Oh, I don't know if that's true, there's. A lot of good examples of that. There's. A lot of great examples of people who have gotten a lot of money in st chill. Oprah and\n\nspk_0 : that's it, uh, that's the list. Thank you, guys. So much for coming out. We appreciate it, charlie. Merry christmas. Happy new year. Please stand up. We're going for here like you've never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the floor like panic. Tommy just burst in the door, started whipping around first before the first with your boy wonder over furniture is returning. Wait, no way, you're kidding!

Yeah, back then you let it go into a cave and not a lot of people\n\nspk_2 : I know that home alone was actually based on whole alone that's the story of a six year old who gets lost in a cave and then thwarts teo golding dweller dwellers\n\nspk_1 : when he was\n\nspk_0 : ten he\n\nspk_1 : dropped out of school and\n\nspk_0 : with a live stone bandits yeah\n\nspk_1 : his planet that point was to just go into caves and look for native american relics that were in there so they quite ambitious job yeah yeah yeah so he would find arrowheads and stuff like that and then taking on sounded tourists great just just making\n\nspk_0 : a living\n\nspk_2 : yeah sure working for a living\n\nspk_1 : dead ten that's we could find a job it's his job normal by twelve he had a he had memorized nearby cave that was huge and then he started checking out other unknown caves around the area okay, so he's the cave boy so the caves aren't the caves air fucking hugh\n\nspk_2 : yeah, these caves there sometimes they're miles\n\nspk_1 : yeah yeah they're massive and yeah and especially these ones here all\n\nspk_2 : right so this twelve year old is just going to cave in\n\nspk_1 : so he's finding moccasins tomahawks beads sometimes the bodies of other explorers who it didn't work out for interesting in nineteen ten in new york geologist paid him to work as a guide in local caves while he was you know, mapping them or whatever for two years. Okay during this time the geologist taught floyd the basics of geology right she's becoming a learned man sure learn it learn and learn and learn erred not learning. No flight became convinced all caves and there you were connected okay so he thinks every single cave in kentucky is connected\n\nspk_2 : together does this end with him finding out chapo yeah okay he\n\nspk_0 : was soon\n\nspk_1 : squeezing through cracks that other explorers were absolutely terrified to go\n\nspk_0 : my boy there's no way I\n\nspk_2 : could fit into going to that new\n\nspk_1 : he became known as kentucky's best cavor so he gets a rap\n\nspk_2 : you mean somebody gets an agent\n\nspk_1 : yeah he got s o this is actually headshot yeah there's that second shot mom that a magazine came and took because he's getting so popular that people like\n\nspk_0 : what are you doing\n\nspk_1 : down there okay and there he is some bones and what not that are in the cave okay people started telling stories of floyd going into caves and coming out miles away popping his head out in some random owners hayfield\n\nspk_2 : okay over right just like a little lack a mall right yes he's like a bugs bunny at the beginning of the cartoons like\n\nspk_0 : I should have gone left at poughkeepsie\n\nspk_2 : but okay you know I mean\n\nspk_1 : yeah that's so that's him so\n\nspk_2 : okay so he's a real cave boy\n\nspk_1 : he's keep boy in nineteen seventeen floyd discovered an amazing underground cavern with vertical walls a smooth sailing and tons of white orange and brown formations he thought it would make his family rich he named it crystal cave and started promoting it to tourists\n\nspk_2 : okay and it it would be just come\n\nspk_1 : and look at the cave\n\nspk_2 : right but it's so remarkable because it's just looking sellers ok yeah\n\nspk_1 : I mean just the way it was huge huge on the inside but also all the colors yeah okay um no one came interesting because there's other caves around okay free caves know their child everyone charges to get tragic there must get their cave they charged people to get in a hole it's a racket okay people would go you take it you take a family trip down to the cave area sure check out kids\n\nspk_2 : going griswald it down ok that's right right it\n\nspk_1 : could only be reached by taking a very rough wagon trail s o he bought a taxi to dr tourists out but it turns out he was a terrible driver he wants actually drove into the broadside of a barn\n\nspk_2 : okay wow that's uh that's bad yeah it's all right he's not great that means should be ableto see that coming I think yeah other\n\nspk_1 : other case so other cave owners don't want him to become successful right? Right because they're competing cave businesses sure so they would tell tourists his cave was closed or blocked the road with boulders and wagon\n\nspk_2 : not even a\n\nspk_0 : cave you know came out there and it's above land look like came out then. Okay? Okay. Trees and stuff.\n\nspk_1 : Then five goons demanded floyd hand over the least to his cave\n\nspk_2 : way don't want to make a difficult tanya but give us the police in the ddr gave okay\n\nspk_1 : there's there's no\n\nspk_0 : give me the paperwork\n\nspk_2 : that says the jewel in that cave uh\n\nspk_1 : first of all I don't have\n\nspk_0 : it way wouldn't want you to fall backwards onto some of those still leg tights I just\n\nspk_1 : you know that yes you sure that's the ones that come up or do you think they're the ones who go down\n\nspk_2 : I could never remember I will don well let me think what did the teacher say what she said was the leg tight hold on touch so I think your point is actually well taken I would not put you back under those still like mites yeah because my now you might hit jin yes actually wrong I was right the first time yeah look\n\nspk_0 : we're going to kill you unless you give\n\nspk_2 : me the least\n\nspk_0 : that's very\n\nspk_1 : s o they beat the living shit out of him they beat him so bloody eyes brother to come out and chased them off with a shotgun brother homer he's got a brother homer just to make sure you make it to normal right just a normal homer so flight keeps on going he's still he's\n\nspk_2 : not intimidated by the cave beating that's right that's for you okay he's not intimidated that that picture looks like when someone estimates what someone will look like when they're older and they've gone missing for sure okay\n\nspk_0 : do you always wear his hat sideways hits that he looks like steve\n\nspk_2 : coogan if he was stung by a wasp\n\nspk_1 : on half his face half of them hey want to find a cave that would blow away the competition and save his family from all their debt problems so he was thirty seven he found a narrow passageway and he spent\n\nspk_0 : he's his whole life\n\nspk_1 : is cave he's teaching he just thinks that he can find the right k perfect k when the family's out of debt no problems that I was going to live happy it's it's like it's strike it rich like gold gold are creating a startup in silicon valley yeah stupid bullshit that people do right okay dognapping made a dog out because you want to put on\n\nspk_2 : this is where I want to know that my brother is\n\nspk_1 : a good idea I got an idea for a dog yeah pond when your dog needs to eat it tells you get bp let's eat when you're\n\nspk_2 : how about this i've got a knack for you it's called dog and your dog tells you when it's hungry oh and the dinanath oh yeah\n\nspk_1 : I don't know how we make money off that yes right that's my point okay yeah well thanks for coming you're welcome s o he's thirty seven he finds us narrow passageway which I will show you I think this has been cleared out a little bit that's what looks like today okay but I think was much much smaller I think at this point there's. Nothing there, but a tiny hole.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, I know it's hard to tell.\n\nspk_1 : We spent two hours a day clearing away gravel in stone's got warlike weeks for weeks, so it's, just going. This little hole is clearing out because he knows he's going to hit a cave at some point, a big cavern on monday, january thirtieth, nineteen twenty five, he walked through the melting snow and headed into the cave. It was warm for the winter, then choose now, a manhole size. He had a kerosene lamp sling over shoulder. Five yards down, he lowers himself into a four foot drop, and then he crawled on his belly on a jagged rocks after fifty feet, squeezed through a tight area by exhaling and pushing his body forward with his toes.\n\nspk_0 : Theo\n\nspk_1 : is the horrifying side from aaron. Aaron is not like caves. He\n\nspk_0 : crossed for a while\n\nspk_1 : and then he had a wiggle through another tight area and then he was in a pit he went down ten feet into another hole and he went through and came out on a ledge that was above a sixty foot room okay they found a room\n\nspk_2 : all right this is it this is the day he discovers this room yeah so he's just finished okay\n\nspk_1 : he just found a fucking giant sixty foot\n\nspk_2 : right ok so he finds a big room\n\nspk_1 : then his lander starts to die okay so he turns back but then he knocks over his lantern no it's now it's pitch black he doesn't panic because he's been in this situation before sure he's fucking floyd collins yeah he's dealt with lights out's not homer yeah he knows how to handle lights out cave his first time goes back through the bottom of the ten foot pit on lunches but his foot was against so he gets in this area and he's going to push himself forward right okay but he puts his foot against a rock and that rock is not solid he pushes and a ton of gravel falls around his legs and his\n\nspk_2 : waist oh no so he can't move so he's buried there and move it it's not doing too well over there\n\nspk_1 : this is this is welcome mccarron's worst nightmare\n\nspk_2 : okay so he is now he's basically like quick sand it himself in the cave?\n\nspk_1 : Yeah he, like all this rubble, falls on him, so he can't. Oh, I should here's a picture about each others. This is like an action shot that they took of him, like a photographer came on, like\n\nspk_0 : let's get you want cave\n\nspk_1 : so that's okay,\n\nspk_2 : it looks like it, allow\n\nspk_1 : so s o this is how he is stuck, it's, not that great, but so that's him beat loudly, going around, doing laying down there. Okay, wow, that stuff is so he's, really he's. Basically, the only thing that's out is like his chest up, rather that he's just covered, right, okay, and he can't move because there's, a big rock on his leg, right ally, has left leg okay again, another, another upsetting noise from aaron. So whenever he moves your struggles, more rocks fall, he clawed at the walls until his fingernails were bloody finally exhausted, he passed out, and when he woke, he just started screaming, that's,\n\nspk_2 : the best way to wake a just wake up scream, right,\n\nspk_1 : just so this is a pattern. He sleeps, he wakes, he screams, he falls asleep, he wakes, he he sleeps, he wakes, he screams, he sleeps, he wakes, he screams hours of this, loses his voice.\n\nspk_0 : Oh man what a good one\n\nspk_1 : his arms go numb because his arms are buried underneath him\n\nspk_2 : sweet when he was leaving\n\nspk_0 : their he went alone once on\n\nspk_1 : top and ones on the bottom so one yeah someone stuck on anything once stuck above but he can't move either one god so ah pain is shooting from his ankle which is injured now the melting snow water happened so because sweet water because of where his face is water is dripping down directly onto his face\n\nspk_2 : so he's just like oh sweet yeah he's just very opening his mouth and filling it like a birdbath I\n\nspk_1 : mean the good good thing he's water the bath thing is that's chinese water torture like that\n\nspk_2 : so yeah but not if you open your mouth not if you open your money okay for normal it's just the head that's getting it good I mean and if you think about it at that rate he could probably get a full sip every two hours if he dies just cards right which is nice yeah yeah\n\nspk_1 : so now twenty five hours go\n\nspk_2 : by jesus titanic sir james franco playing\n\nspk_0 : and and no one no one\n\nspk_1 : up top has been worried until now because they're used to floyd going on going\n\nspk_0 : i'm going to plug\n\nspk_1 : in and and then he'll come out of a cave somewhere and be like hey jimmy good to stay with you and then the gas leak in the barn or whatever so they're used to me being gone for a long time but then after after like thirty hours I think it it was this they start to go off voice not around and they\n\nspk_0 : start talking if i'd say your place last night\n\nspk_1 : and open up now and then the seventeen kid goes out looking for floyd and hey finds the whole worms down into the cave but he couldn't get anywhere close because he could not do what floyd he couldn't know floyd's the best floyd's the best k bar in there that's what floyd went through to get around that looks like that is that a restaurant they give you kid that's the top so we went that you went all way down across backup he's this it's a shit show so the kid yells his name and floyd yells back\n\nspk_0 : come to mei i'm hung up\n\nspk_2 : i'm hung up and the kids\n\nspk_0 : I cannot do\n\nspk_1 : and the kid ran out to get help so one by one men start coming and they try to get it going each one wants to be the hero go in the cave in reform but they can't get anywhere fucking close no wonder everyone's like jesus christ eh so they would fail they come out they be soaked in mud saying they would never go down on that hellish whole again so by mid afternoon done, dozens of locals are gathered at the hole when floyd's twenty two year old brother homer arrives\n\nspk_0 : hi man should I shoot it some\n\nspk_1 : men are outside the cave arguing I have a picture of floor homer when I want that homer there's up from up there it wasn't that homer okay no uh yeah i'm not sure that you're okay so so homer goes into the cave men argue outside he castrated he just walks by everybody are going trying to figure what to do okay thie cave smells like cigarettes and alcohol from all the guys who've gone before\n\nspk_2 : s o those gentlemen while they're going down there to save this manner also having a drink a smoke also\n\nspk_1 : I might want to drink before I went in the cave I think about it or drink with him in the cage\n\nspk_2 : yeah no for sure definitely get down there that\n\nspk_0 : alright up ten feet down goingto have a whiskey and a pall mall over to whiskey is also\n\nspk_1 : moonshine territory of jesus um so homer get\n\nspk_0 : everybody in the\n\nspk_2 : eighteen hundreds was like the beginning of a pry lasek commercial what pounding like turkey legs and just bath booze I\n\nspk_0 : don't I don't know I don't know\n\nspk_1 : at what point this happened but to get through others homer I don't know which one of these this one right here my guess is that one the one that looks absolutely terrified\n\nspk_0 : I usedto blank but then I stopped so he takes\n\nspk_1 : off he gets in the cable ways and then to get through. The skinny places he takes off his pants shirt and shoes and slithers through in his underwear\n\nspk_0 : i'm coming brother naked it's gonna be weird when I get there super weird alright brother have scraped up in hard and naked give me your hand do you want the moon shot it does what you homer here we go your own caven come on take your clothes off we're gonna be naked hero is not going to take my clothes off get out of your home and I look foolish if your clothes and I am yeah well that ain't now that ain't right at all flying what you're doing a run all right t wood i'm gonna put on a glove then I won't be naked that's come out smile with you i'm drunk i've been trying to get out here for a while I drink a lot of shine I am blanked in years\n\nspk_1 : so when homer gets to the ten foot pitch right that's this area he realized the horror of the situation so he's there enough right if one went into the chute headfirst he'd have to work upside down and to get out he didn't go home first and that's twenty feet before turnaround has twenty feet up sure so if you\n\nspk_2 : go feet first you're really doing\n\nspk_1 : then you right so you have to contort yourself into almost impossible positions to get down to reach him, right? So that's, what homer did? He went down feet first and then he calls for something to bring down bring down food and then someone else comes in and homer fled fed floyd by hand nine sausage sandwiches and a pint of coffee poured the copy daughter's throat she agrees\n\nspk_0 : right he's also flat kind so\n\nspk_1 : wow so he ate a lot he was hungry but united sausage sandwich imagine they weren't that big time ever do one more\n\nspk_0 : slide you have shit how long you been down there\n\nspk_2 : a pot of coffee too morning lord sugar\n\nspk_1 : so more men go down and and fade away today skip okay sorry homer comes out try it tries tries to remove rocks around floyd he can't there just to fuck impact him but he's he's feet first or yesterday's feet first so you crouch down a little\n\nspk_2 : bit when he's fighting with you just like between his savage way of dropping sausage this basin was opened\n\nspk_1 : my picture but that's what you painted but that's what's happening she's a feed on each side of his head\n\nspk_0 : it's basically called outhouse and it's where I squat naked and drop food and a asshole\n\nspk_1 : you can actually online there floyd porn and that's what this just after food and his brother's\n\nspk_2 : mouth man cave look at that he'd let me look\n\nspk_1 : at them size just going at my i'm gonna\n\nspk_2 : close big bat\n\nspk_1 : so I can't get him out and and when he tries to pull rocks out more fallen it's just a fucking shit show so he decides to bail and then he goes back up top because he's exhausted he\n\nspk_0 : well I will say having\n\nspk_2 : nine sausage sandwiches is probably well I mean there's the upside being like there's now some something's going through your body the down side is it's you know probably you're gonna have to go potty soon\n\nspk_1 : yeah it's floyd comes out that's what he looks like when he comes out\n\nspk_0 : what they get it\n\nspk_2 : oh that's floyd right now that's homer that's floyd right there sorry that's homer that's homer okay yeah that looks like a beat up clown\n\nspk_1 : yeah he had a rough time down there because it's brutal for these guys to do these moves to get down and get back up it's a fucking unbelievable for these guys for floyd it was no no issue hey came out a whole hours later he's shivering violently skin was dangling from his fingers so he takes a break more men go down fail they can't get near him nobody could reach him homer went back down at midnight for eight hours homer hacked at the rocks around floyd with the crowbar no luck he came up at sunrise his arms of backache his lungs burned there are now tons of strange people up top smelled like moonshine flight have been trapped for forty eight hours\n\nspk_2 : so they've just turned it into sort of a music festival\n\nspk_1 : why wouldn't they just sitting out there is the maze will drink and stay warm and whatnot right drink and stay warm yeah what's that I would do so he so it's it's it's it's a fucking mess\n\nspk_2 : and we're on I mean we're what like three days and now\n\nspk_1 : forty eight hours a day it has been down there for forty eight hours um and so they're so they're starting to set stuff up and rest and try to rescue him\n\nspk_2 : there doing a really dig\n\nspk_1 : you know the sort of dig and do different things them start a really big yet but they're starting like open trying to open up the hole and open up spaces inside sure\n\nspk_2 : at least create some sort of shoot for the sausage sandwiches just landed\n\nspk_1 : just got bad that bad really fast new man had ideas the newman arrived one said floyd should untie your shoes i'm\n\nspk_2 : smart so that guy's understands the situation and knows how to fix it guy comes over than idea a plan\n\nspk_0 : sight hey boys yeah no I just got here but i'm thinking as in my home\n\nspk_1 : heard about this came down\n\nspk_0 : yelp tried on tying his shoes well promise was fixing on tie shoes his head and his torso and the rocks are in\n\nspk_2 : the way so we can't get to his feet\n\nspk_0 : but if you can got a record deal I got you untie the shoot I\n\nspk_2 : felt let me just jump in here that's an impossibility unless we came from the other side, which we would not know how to do. All right, that's, not it. All right is not an answer. Today's\n\nspk_1 : just wondered if they might be double knot\n\nspk_2 : it that's all he can't get to them\n\nspk_1 : may because they're double\n\nspk_2 : knot. We can't get to them. All\n\nspk_0 : right? Want to go back home, boys, please, d'oh! Remember the two? Remember the shoe thing? I talked about blue out. Another said send\n\nspk_1 : a contortionist down with a mallet and chisel\n\nspk_0 : now crazy! I heard about every crazy idea that's imaginable.\n\nspk_1 : Another said used dynamite.\n\nspk_0 : Now, for the last time, the way to fix this problem is toe blow florida up that's, right. We want to blow the hole so no one can get out or in now, for the last time, we need the contortionist from ocean's eleven to get down there, he's the only one who can fit into that hole.\n\nspk_1 : Someone said they should amputate the foot's and see if he can make it out before he bled\n\nspk_0 : out. Okay, so we're\n\nspk_2 : really fun. Sort of that tail tail race against time.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, that god wanted like a clock situation happening. Yeah, the way\n\nspk_0 : we cut him in half and raise them separately. Homer asked\n\nspk_1 : some teenagers to being floyd down some blank oh and food and drinks on a went and they could make it anywhere near down and they just stuffed all the food drinks and blankets in the cracks in the cave and\n\nspk_2 : left he was real happy mr\n\nspk_1 : grown grown men to the same thing and they all lie and said they had given food to him\n\nspk_2 : shit so he's just like plays homer is the only one who'll feed him\n\nspk_1 : that's right a reporter of approached homer and omer said quote if you want information there's a hole right over there you condone not go down and find out yourself now the reporter's name it's skeet\n\nspk_2 : oh if there's any reporter that sounds like the he'll go down the hole it's one named skeets\n\nspk_1 : skeets miller well so he's been down now he's been down the hole for it's like fifty hours supporters name windy miller known a skeet he's twenty one you put on coveralls and headed in he's skinny one hundred seventeen pounds\n\nspk_2 : this reporter was like all right\n\nspk_1 : yep he's never he's never cabe he's not a caver he's scared he crawls in he squeezes all the way through because he's so skinny\n\nspk_0 : florida eyewitness news hello what's your what's your favorite kind of food have you tried tying your shoes eggs iran minds want to know that the last tight\n\nspk_1 : spot skeets called for floyd and heard a groan oh, sauce head so skeet slides down the ten foot pit and landed on floyd's\n\nspk_2 : head oh good that's what he needed was a concussion twenty foot funk yeah no skeets\n\nspk_0 : apologized this is like the goonies theo\n\nspk_1 : he goes back up and carefully slid back down so he would not be on top of floyd oh cool but boy it is completely incoherent at this point why I don't know okay lazy yeah skeets headed back out flooded now been trapped for seventy three hours\n\nspk_0 : well I kicked his head real good he's all right he's hungry and I kicked his head hard he made some moment it's not good\n\nspk_1 : s so he's hallucinating he's seeing angels wrapped in white linens riding blazing chariots you\n\nspk_2 : think that means you're close\n\nspk_1 : yeah he smelled liver and onions freshly frost cow's milk and chicken sandwiches\n\nspk_2 : so he's just smelling an after life potluck\n\nspk_1 : he hey it's it's now monday february second\n\nspk_2 : I don't want to live I got to go eat potluck with the angels\n\nspk_1 : you had done on friday lieutenant robert burden a thirty three year old louisville firefighter arrived he was confident and very arrogant he was also super skinny in he went when he reached floyd he said quote you\n\nspk_0 : got a hell of a problem here but I think we can get you out with a rope\n\nspk_2 : okay I like that idea\n\nspk_1 : voice it okay, yeah let's do this burn then looked more sized up the whole area and said quote\n\nspk_0 : might have to pull your foot off off off off off I think that foot off take the foot off that was another guy's pull\n\nspk_1 : not take her out poor\n\nspk_2 : off pull the foot off yeah with the rope right now on real when we\n\nspk_0 : pull the road\n\nspk_1 : we're thinking baby come out\n\nspk_2 : right okay so have the foot thorne off\n\nspk_1 : i'm a fireman okay right floyd didn't care he said quote pull my foot off get me out wow he's tired of it seventy two year into our shirt yeah\n\nspk_0 : burden may\n\nspk_1 : not have known floyd had lost his mind earlier that day I was hallucinating anyway he thought he got approval he goes out no he tells everyone floyd it had agreed to the rope pulling plan okay the crowd did not approve every one of the locals are like that that doesn't sound that sounds like medieval like fucked up just like a crazy louisville man\n\nspk_0 : try taking his shares off taking untied the show shows I just say that a runaway\n\nspk_2 : getting dragged out of the place\n\nspk_1 : s o they said it would break his foot or if it didn't pull off like it would be a disaster so a docked in the crowd said the rope pull would stretch floyd's internal organs like taffy so there's a lot\n\nspk_2 : of the doctors good there's a lot of against on the doctor understands what's going on\n\nspk_1 : he's like don't know\n\nspk_0 : gentlemen intestines are taffy.\n\nspk_1 : Yeah, so he's a weird one yeah he was also like\n\nspk_0 : what we've pulled apart we'll be in taffy for weeks you ask taffy and says every\n\nspk_2 : man knows and as any man of science knows we're all filled with different\n\nspk_0 : came let me show you boys move oh god it's not tuffy now if we're not careful we might strike the now and later and then the skittles of everywhere\n\nspk_1 : burton says look there's no other option i've been down there all we can do is pulling with rope the locals had no responses they had no ideas so everyone agrees reluctantly okay let's pull him out with rope okay five pm a body harness was brought down put around him homer skeets and burden went in with a hundred foot rope when they got to floyd homer gave him ham sandwiches coffee and whiskey ok sure that's great then floyd said he didn't actually want to have his foot pulled off\n\nspk_2 : so now he's had some food is like\n\nspk_0 : way doing uh I had this a bad idea yeah wait, I have a thing that I like my foot well we're not as worried\n\nspk_2 : about the foot but the doctor pointed out your taffy might get everywhere. Good god. So so now he's come teo and he's like\n\nspk_1 : let's not do this right. So homer slipped him a sedative probably in some food sure knock him out. Okay, quote to build up his vitality to stand the shock if we did pull off his foot!\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, that's, what it does, it really heightens the experience.\n\nspk_1 : Homer tied the harness around and put the harness room tied the rope. Skeets was crouched at the top of the pit. Burton is further up in the cave. Several other men helped near the cave's mouth, and on homer's count, they all sort of pulling okay, and floyd screen\n\nspk_2 : like. Shit damn it okay so he's just him or at bain so it\n\nspk_0 : turns out he's\n\nspk_1 : lying face up right in a horizontal horizontally face up\n\nspk_2 : he's laying like is\n\nspk_1 : lower well sort of his lower body trapped and his back is kind of turned into an l his\n\nspk_2 : back okay so is his spine is sort of tilted you mad okay\n\nspk_1 : yeah down like it's it's like its eyes like that it's like angle\n\nspk_2 : okay so it's a lot harder to pull them out so in other words they were talking about maybe taking off the bottom half right right right right so from the belly button below sort of yeah s o i'm gonna need to give another knockout ham sandwich\n\nspk_1 : so that he just started screaming\n\nspk_0 : don't do it don't do it don't do it\n\nspk_1 : and then we get here all the way through the cave which they've now they've now named the sand cave um yeah so homer sort of pulling in the opposite direction and as everyone knows he starts pulling the other way sure back towards anyone else and hey had enough strength to pull it from the other men's hands okay homer does like a feat of strength thing\n\nspk_2 : floyd does homer oh it's homer doing okay\n\nspk_1 : s so it's over didn't go well bad plan they head back out to re evaluate their like we can't pull him he screams and i'd get torn in half right she's a sum there are particular they're all pretty freaked out by what had happened burden the fireman fainted as he got near the exit okay his idea thanks right the crowd outside is getting larger it has been eighty eight hours oh my god she's then came floyd's childhood friend johnny gerald johnny gerald when johnny first heard that floyd was stuck in a cave he shrugged and kept on chaperone in the local high school boy scout's voice boy boys basketball team that night he's champion he's not worried at all he'd explored caves with floyd all of his childhood if anyone could get out floyd could get out but after two days he started to worry and he headed for the cave and when he arrived there on two hundred people mostly shitfaced hardly any with caving experience and johnny was really disgusted by the idea of trying to pull floyd out\n\nspk_2 : right he's the basketball coach so he's like run the triangle offense\n\nspk_0 : and now he's\n\nspk_1 : a coach or we just like hangs out make sure they don't get in trouble sure deal because you know basketball players yeah you know they liked to do their thing yeah for sure what so s so hee so hee he goes down hey he's a he's cannot believe all the bottles and the clothes and the shit cramming cracks like a six flags at night he's like we could open a store down here quote enough sandwiches in the cave to feed! The whole crowd\n\nspk_0 : there's a vendor how you doing sara tacky legs\n\nspk_1 : that floyd was thrilled when he heard johnny was coming\n\nspk_0 : down I mean imagine like communiqu hey flied make the place look nice you've got a visitor to one of your old friends coming down close your ass thank a quote let him down here he'll get me out oh oh man he's gotta be just out of his mind yeah anyone is coming eighteen hours that bring him out down he'll fix this but johnny was stocky\n\nspk_1 : could not fit down the ten foot pit so he pulled rocks away until he was able to slink down around midnight then he started removing the gravel around floyd he spent the next six hours trying to enlarge the area floyd's torso appeared and then his hips and then his upper thigh\n\nspk_2 : sorry this great plan was to dig the gravel out from around him\n\nspk_1 : well but that's the first thing have to do before you do anything\n\nspk_2 : else get about why is nobody else done this? I don't know that would be like the first thing you want right dio I\n\nspk_1 : think johnny has a lot of caving experience so maybe he's just like get out the rocks before you do that for you\n\nspk_2 : ripped the man in half\n\nspk_1 : nobody else knows. Okay, so he's he's pulling out all the rocks so he's done with you these hips than his upper thigh. So he's always done to his upper thigh and for the first time floyd could wiggle his right leg as painful is that\n\nspk_2 : oh my god the atrophy then he\n\nspk_1 : could also move his arms and his hands this is the\n\nspk_2 : feeling now you can finally eat the senate yeah that's\n\nspk_1 : right but johnny was too big to reach past foy's knees but he he moved about a half ton of rock at that point wow yeah it's pretty fucking amazing yeah so before he goes up floyd told him quote not to let anyone come down here down there but him and his party so he's like just you johnny your party happy nobody else your boys only john agreed thinking outsiders could cause a cave in so he's worried about people coming into the cave you don't know anything about kate when he got back to the surface he was approached by a group of professional stone cutters okay that they don't find him doing that guys who work on jewelry there's fucking I don't know maybe maybe they cut bigger stones but they want to chisel the limestone above floyd's head and giant tell him to get the fuck out okay,\n\nspk_0 : we want to cut the part ofthe above his head and then what happens with rock falls down was hit but then\n\nspk_2 : you've got his feet how we get them out ideally so then we can finally take his\n\nspk_0 : shoes off. Get him out of there.\n\nspk_1 : So the fireman lieutenant burden comes back at ten a m and he has great eddie he says they should try to pull him out with rope again\n\nspk_2 : yeah smart that's good that was those clothes last time but\n\nspk_0 : I mean in a way he's looser right like is it is it now time is that these occurs because you guys I got your drink a moment been thinking all night long\n\nspk_1 : got a great idea all right let's pull mac\n\nspk_2 : all right great how\n\nspk_0 : what do the\n\nspk_1 : same thing put a rope around\n\nspk_2 : way tried that planet almost repeated Denver this time will be different i'm not going to do that eso\n\nspk_1 : this time honey he said that idea when everyone shouted fuck you adam and heat and that was\n\nspk_2 : okay so he had a good run\n\nspk_1 : yeah eso now floyd is blurb in newspapers across the country this is because skeets had written a story right flight have been trapped now for one hundred and three hour ours my gods so skeets goes back to the cave\n\nspk_2 : sure for the follow up I\n\nspk_1 : already did that skeets there's no escape ski's goes back to the cave whoa hello skates he's not for kim around get some ladies\n\nspk_2 : i've got skates with the deets at eleven\n\nspk_1 : so the idea was to set up a chain of men who would pass food equipment and rocks up and down the passenger way while reinforcing it with boards. Okay, so you got guys moving rocks out at the same time taking boards and put him against the side of the cave\n\nspk_2 : ok she essentially building a mine\n\nspk_1 : you're building in mind light bulbs be set throughout the cave low so so they did that so that was like an orange glow throughout the cave that's nice yeah skeets would then go down and try to remove rocks and gravel from around floyd the whole run floyd's torso had now had five inches of clearance okay that's pretty good and is great skeets could prop his legs past floyd's head and wiggle hip deep in in this weird position he would pop past floyd's knee so\n\nspk_0 : she's hobbling fraud on\n\nspk_1 : top of him\n\nspk_2 : right oh feet first right okay\n\nspk_1 : to get in deep enough to then dig I don't know how this works\n\nspk_2 : it's almost like spelunking sixty nine it's now it's a sex cave okay so but he is essentially he's going over him\n\nspk_1 : is over he's on top of him he's laying on him he's diggin past unease able to reach past the name so for two hours skeets passed up buckets of dirt and rocks employees start floyd starts to talk quote I\n\nspk_0 : believe I would go to heaven but I can feel that I am to be taken out alive and with both my feet four days down here and no nearer\n\nspk_1 : to freedom that I was the first day\n\nspk_0 : how will it end? How will I get out\n\nspk_1 : or I couldn't think of it. I have faced death before it doesn't frighten me but it is\n\nspk_0 : so long no god be merciful I want you to tell everybody outside that I love everyone in them and i'm happy because so many were trying to help me tell them i'm not going to give up\n\nspk_1 : i'm going to fight and be patient and never forget them\n\nspk_0 : you go out now but don't don't leave me too long I want you with me know and i'll keep helping all aiken can to move some of this rock\n\nspk_2 : boy oh boy\n\nspk_1 : skeets goes back out so floyd's doing well yeah he's keeping it together yeah he writes up he writes up what he said the story he writes up what happened in this trip on dso now floyd is a nationwide event of course front page head of course\n\nspk_2 : it's bound to happen\n\nspk_1 : skeets also wrote about his own feelings of fear so so normally at this time reporters are not supposed to ever put their feelings into something but skeets did right he didn't do the weird and then it it isn't he like put how scary wass and all that shit in there so everyone's like reading and they're totally on edge and into this story play houses around the country would be interrupted during this show to update audience\n\nspk_0 : i'm sorry everybody way all know how\n\nspk_2 : macbeth and so we're going to take a quick time out.\n\nspk_0 : Floyd has had his eighth sausage\n\nspk_2 : biscuit and he believes that he saw the devil all\n\nspk_0 : right as you are\n\nspk_1 : that's for you so boy hey was dapper before he went down there in dc president coolidge followed the story closely congress stopped debates to find out what was going on\n\nspk_2 : now hold on ahh ahh yield I yield to the newsboy into the news of the cave man\n\nspk_0 : go ahead newsboy yell something well hamza fixing the lave stale that was great assassin to come in\n\nspk_1 : here floyd got an offer of three hundred fifty dollars a week to start a vaudeville\n\nspk_0 : show may be premature but I like the way he does things now has your tapping floyd before we put the deal together can you tap assuming you leave with both feet I could tap with my nose all right and what about the monologues do you feel good about memories they wanna uh already and how do you feel about working with a female maybe we do something a little bit less key you any ah like a foot no right well great for it will draw this up and I think we're gonna love\n\nspk_2 : you assuming you make it out of here alive\n\nspk_0 : what assuming we get out here alive we can't wait to put together a show for vaudeville boy real razzmatazz you'll see remember that kid who fell down the well lost his arm i'm the one who made him us now. Household name dead tommy that's right dead tommy was nothing to tell me so i'm the one who suggested he bleed out\n\nspk_1 : so now skeets got more and more determined to save floyd he wrote quote I believe I can save him yet I know it in his last store and he went back down this\n\nspk_0 : time he\n\nspk_1 : planned to use a jack to lift the stones off lloyd's foot okay but the team couldn't find the right size jack sure so ski fuse one that was too small and he piled wood blocks against the cave ceiling uh and grab the blocks with one hand while wrenching the jack with the others he basically made like a post right in a way to hold onto okay reaches in with the jack with the other and he would loosen this rock that was on his foot which would then move to the side and slip loose and go back down okay so if he had had a better bigger jack this might have worked so he's also in a super awkward position because it just there's no room so it's causing him tremendous pain in his abdominals his back his neck has risked\n\nspk_2 : everything to bring that up down there and this forum no my back is so sore\n\nspk_0 : really yeah it's just well this I mean I understand yeah yeah my arm to god you know what hurts on may like oh foot i'm just saying oh, every all the whole thing\n\nspk_2 : i'm going to get\n\nspk_0 : out of your fucking back hurt?\n\nspk_2 : I'm getting. Besides tonight, I have to\n\nspk_0 : I have had the shit since eight, those nineteen sausage sandwiches, by the way, you set a record most sausages eaten in a cave. Yeah, there's. A certificate for a great day. Huge those shits one hundred twenty hours a day.\n\nspk_1 : Um, so this goes on. I mean, for a while, he tries again, the rock lurches, floyd yells,\n\nspk_0 : keep turning, fella that's coming off\n\nspk_1 : with each turn, the stone shifts and falls and it goes back on his foot, ski tries again and again again, he moves around. He tries different angles. He tries every little angle in the whole fucking space, but what he really needed was the third hand. He didn't have one, so he finally collapses from exhaustion. Burton burton was there, quote, we all felt like sitting down right there and crying. It was awful,\n\nspk_2 : my crazy to suggest wrapping a rope around the guy.\n\nspk_1 : Skeet then adjusted floyd's covers and put a light bulb around his neck for warmth sleep without prints and he left skates hands were purple and bruised up above the national guard arrived\n\nspk_2 : ok right on time but\n\nspk_0 : skeets\n\nspk_1 : miller was now a hero the courier journal wrote quote cave city that's the nearby city cave city is skeets crazy in fact\n\nspk_0 : if cave city where kingdom skeets could be the\n\nspk_1 : reigning monarch without the slightest hint of revolt among his royal subjects\n\nspk_2 : side away king skates should be a rapper\n\nspk_1 : yes how is that not\n\nspk_0 : king skates what's up king skates in the house\n\nspk_1 : gets whatever whenever he left his hotel room tourist would swarm him on informal bodyguard followed him around\n\nspk_2 : an informal bodyguard guy and I mean it was just like\n\nspk_1 : a guy goes that you yeah that happened with the bundys oh right about doing i'll be your bodyguard now i'm down on the bayou boutte who went to prison for being an idiot well at the cave a new manta go over henry carmichael the general superintendent of the kentucky rock asphalt company okay henry was appalled at the primitive rescue attempts at two thirty a m on wednesday henry sent two men down to assess stability okay guys they're going down to check everything\n\nspk_2 : out no must be nice for flight to meet some more people\n\nspk_1 : now the\n\nspk_0 : opening of\n\nspk_1 : the cave wass now wire than ever because of that human chain right, so they have the big fucking human chain right who are getting stuff out like to bring it out she's hundred dirt like\n\nspk_2 : other all in suits it's like you're going to go dig holes and guys like well just wear my diggin suit\n\nspk_1 : you gotta dress up um so as they go deeper the cave actually gets tighter normally Kentucky Cave zaveri stabler and are always forty five degrees okay sorry fifty four degrees but this situation is different because the human chain it happened okay so they had all this human's line all the way up the top and i'll lie back down which causes a cave to get warmer\n\nspk_2 : okay he's got a hot cave\n\nspk_1 : so skeets came up no wait right so ski skis came up with the idea for the human chain which caused the cape temperature to fluctuate from all the bodies and all the campfires up above short balding slow snow into the cave okay so it's hot and it's wet weather than it should be water is pouring into the tunnel large cracks start forming remember cars topography it is a limestone cave dolomite or whatever ceiling starts to droop no no on the cave one of the two volunteers sent down got super close they hear floyd moaning as well as the rumble of sliding rocks so that guy turns around he doesn't go he doesn't go out but he goes i'm getting out of this area\n\nspk_2 : yeah good to\n\nspk_0 : me and go get my butt.\n\nspk_1 : Um, the second volunteer, casey jones, kept going, and he got to the ten foot pit and he looked at floyd. Um, he tried to ignore that there are pebbles falling around him.\n\nspk_0 : Don't worry, flight, this is fine, just raining rocks,\n\nspk_1 : my friend floyd, bed casey to come down, quote,\n\nspk_0 : can't now, floyd, but I will when I come\n\nspk_1 : back. Floyd said, quote,\n\nspk_0 : i'm thirsty. Of course you are. Please. Yep, I need water, buddy, all right, sit a bit.\n\nspk_1 : Casey fell for it. He slit first down into the pit and handed floyd some coffee.\n\nspk_0 : Drink up money, you thirsty, costumey, coffee,\n\nspk_2 : that's, nice, the way you also want to be up a cz muchas possible\n\nspk_0 : tea cup of tea, but you want\n\nspk_2 : love a lot. Um, vanilla, soy. I hate to be that guy.\n\nspk_0 : Caramel macchiato.\n\nspk_1 : Floyd didn't want the coffee. Kacey realized floyd wasn't thirsty. He just didn't want to be alone. He was thirsty in a way, casey's partner yelled the guy, the first guy,\n\nspk_2 : yeah, the guy, smart guy, let's call him\n\nspk_1 : smart, yeah, he says, we need to get the fuck out, okay, smart guy earning the name casey put down the ladle and scrambled out,\n\nspk_2 : always late, early coffee here, go find as\n\nspk_0 : he looks\n\nspk_1 : back, he saw the passage closed like a vice. Now floyd still had the light bulb on his chest on the floor am for him on wednesday. Ah, february, for I don't know that put some house here, our one hundred fourteen, the wall's clamp shot, and the karen floyd went completely dark. His muffled sobs could be heard behind the rock.\n\nspk_0 : I don't know, so no it's, just the work. She has fucking worse.\n\nspk_2 : Yeah, well, plus with those tears, he'll be loosening some of the rocks\n\nspk_1 : and he's crying.\n\nspk_0 : Stay with me. Oh, please don't leave. Please don't leave, boy. All right, we gotta get out of here. All right?\n\nspk_1 : So they go up, uh, on the morning, skeets arise with the torch. The plan is to burn away the rocks that blocked the way burn away the rocks. So these air soluble rot like the I don't know if it's possible to burn limestone, but probably is might take a long fucking time. Sure, but remember, water can dissolve these rocks. There's that makes sense. But, I mean, it takes a while\n\nspk_2 : for it's just insulting tactic to be like, we're gonna burn you out of here.\n\nspk_1 : But I would imagine, I imagine he had looked it up, and I would imagine limestone rocks or dolomite or whatever could be burned. If it worked, the jacking would be easy. But he was told the cable close shut. He couldn't believe it. And he went down himself to see it was\n\nspk_0 : blocked it it's where? Do it. Down there. And I heard the caves crying. The cave rocks are crying s so weird eso so weird right here, drinks coffee and ah! All right, shut up. Rocks? Yeah.\n\nspk_1 : Um so he comes back out when he comes out. Is noticed. Nose is bleeding. He's been down there now. Was that your of time? Skeets tells burden, quote, for god's sakes, do not got go back down there and see that homer cones doesn't go in again. So skeets has given up was like, this shit is fucked, there's. Nothing that's gonna happen. But the\n\nspk_0 : person they needed teo stopped\n\nspk_1 : from going down was floyd's. Childhood friend johnny and johnny was pissed. He had\n\nspk_0 : said all\n\nspk_1 : along not to put any people into the cave because it would heat the cave and cause it to change and collapse. And no one listened. So, skeets idea. Skeets, the hero had actually hurt the situation, caused it to be a fucking disaster. Right? So johnny got a group together that evening. Quote, there's death down there. The walls and ceiling are\n\nspk_0 : crumbling unless you are determined\n\nspk_1 : to take the biggest chance you ever took in your life. Tell me now and stay outside. I said alex jones, quote. Yeah. That's the same speech that they didn't glengarry glen ross without father. So, he's saying, this is a death row. Yeah, so some guys volunteer. Over the next eight hours, johnny would enter and leave the cave five times at least five times, maybe more what's he doing down there s o he's sawing and chopping trees up top, showing at the cave walls again. Underground, a crew was reinforcing cracks and wobbling boulders and removing rocks, okay, so sort of preventive movement, and then taken out the ones they needed to get out of the way, right when they could hear each other. Johnny giant, old floyd. There had been a breakdown and fully just started to cry.\n\nspk_2 : Okay, seems like flies on handling this too well. Well, they always say that after five days in a cave, you start to go\n\nspk_1 : a little batty. Yeah. Um, I got that. Thanks. I'm not, don't you think I didn't get it? Like I know bats live in caves? Sure. It's me, it's. A good bet. So johnny surgically tried to remove the rocks in a few hours he could see light from the bull around forge next he's cutting through the rock thank you this was happening then johnny could squeeze through so johnny went to the service to get equipment and said floyd would be up in an hour\n\nspk_2 : well that's quite a claim like\n\nspk_1 : i'm digging him out get him out it now but one hundred thirty to us us christ no a\n\nspk_0 : ten thirty p m attended to b\n\nspk_1 : m on friday february fourth johnny went in he squeezed and crawled he plan to use a grease gun to coat the rocks are on floyd's leg to get him out so he had a fucking plan sure squeeze it\n\nspk_2 : squeeze it grease it slide\n\nspk_0 : it out yeah it's a three step process\n\nspk_1 : used to do his lady you can do with floyd wait but when they\n\nspk_0 : got to the\n\nspk_1 : cave there was no light shining through the ceiling had collapsed once again johnny l for floyd a big rock fell and hit him on the head\n\nspk_2 : hit hit johnny on that okay\n\nspk_1 : johnny heard a moan and quote i've\n\nspk_0 : done gone home and gone to bed\n\nspk_1 : floyd was losing consciousness yeah johnny start to clear the passage ignoring the pain from his head he clawed at the stones then a sharp heavy rock fell and hit him squarely on his back. Fifteen minutes later johnny came out and look at the men quote I would not go back in that durn place if they did me the state of kentucky\n\nspk_0 : well funny you should say that you have given a bargain that I cannot say no to\n\nspk_2 : the man with the sash\n\nspk_0 : i'm the man\n\nspk_2 : with the mayor sash\n\nspk_0 : have you noticed I have on this hat\n\nspk_2 : I will\n\nspk_0 : draw the paperwork up big tall black hat said but johnny\n\nspk_2 : really is like the guy who gives you hope\n\nspk_1 : johnny is the fucking hero\n\nspk_2 : he's the light of the end of the tunnel\n\nspk_1 : that is correct I wish I had a picture johnny I couldn't find one so prom or something no okay so so now lieutenant general h h Denver heart of the national guard said they were going to dig a shaft straight down to get him okay so now they're fucked the cave right so they're going over to where he is which looks like it's like sixty seventy feet maybe and then they're gonna dig straight down because because you can't see this but basically floyd is called flight has crawled into a hole and then down and then sideways and he's sixty feet deep okay\n\nspk_2 : so his plan is to dig sixty feet down try to him like basically build a well and pull him out\n\nspk_1 : yeah it's going to go home and pull him out man holmes what you gonna do?\n\nspk_2 : I'd rather it be a functioning\n\nspk_1 : water holder in the meadowbrook there's\n\nspk_0 : coffee and\n\nspk_1 : there's well so now the state has assumed control of the big states taken over no mourners private business Denver art told homer would take quote men with brains to get floyd out that's why he was in charge\n\nspk_0 : you know what you guys need you guys need an asshole\n\nspk_2 : yeah I mean seriously that's right\n\nspk_0 : i'm the fbi agent and die hard tack\n\nspk_1 : for the president henry carmichael was told teo lead the dick volunteers from the louisville and Nashville railroad the southern signal company in the u s mines rescue team and the engineers from the state highway commission pitched in the local townspeople were told to sit this one out\n\nspk_0 : but we was in on your dumb locals we was fancy and the mob the brings here why do you think it was a big hat a lot of brain\n\nspk_2 : hey is smart he's\n\nspk_0 : had sherry's wouldn't that be stupid if I was in charge of the national guard well I don't\n\nspk_2 : think in this country anybody who's idiotic will rise to the top of any situations right you must be smaller\n\nspk_1 : but your ship down you dumb local motherfucker\n\nspk_2 : I like the way he talks to us his rhetoric is something I respond to\n\nspk_1 : so this caused resentment amongst the townspeople a geology professor came and explained that the best place to dig where the best place to dig wells but the local said\n\nspk_2 : he around yeah shut him down\n\nspk_1 : and they complained to the officials they said digging his shaft would take way too long even skeets who had once been full of optimism was now completely full of despair test soon proved with locals knew that the fancy having machinery and they wanted to use could not be used because the cave basically inhales exhaust gas powered engines just going so it would just suck the fumes and kill floyd so they realize that and they realized they would have to dig the fifty five foot shaft with picks and shovels\n\nspk_2 : I mean but also fun bonding and just takes a little longer\n\nspk_1 : come more minutes maybe our one hundred forty six\n\nspk_0 : god well thursday\n\nspk_1 : went down in front on how I know what he's gonna tell us, boss\n\nspk_2 : oh, yeah now he's not gonna buy that. I'm\n\nspk_0 : sorry you were where five and I got why don't you say that to my face\n\nspk_1 : again? You mean you\n\nspk_0 : were in a cave? Yeah, you know what? You're\n\nspk_1 : demoted. You're on the grill\n\nspk_0 : you're under girl. No, I don't need this shit. I went down a cave. I've been in the hole for five days. Fucking floyd, i'm not a fucking business. I'm running. I\n\nspk_2 : know. Sorry. King of\n\nspk_1 : burgers. Looking hole. Liar! Ah, harry! Harry henry, car mogul estimate it would take thirty hours to dig the shaft.\n\nspk_2 : Well, he's got it. Floyd's got the time. Yep. Had to clear the docket by the\n\nspk_0 : evening,\n\nspk_1 : the men start to slow down on the digging that at ten, feet, the chef narrowed so only two men could get down there and work at a time. At fifteen, feet, the shovels hit boulders. They started using police and buckets mules to pull the rocks out. The sun set on rose. It was an unusually warm friday. Now, right now, it's been a week it's friday. Jesus.

Homes were turned into temporary hotels. Accommodations were so limited that visitors paid to nap in bathtubs, not\n\nspk_0 : sleep overnight,\n\nspk_2 : just nap. It's. A tough nap, although when you think about floyd,\n\nspk_1 : so it's like a carnival.

Still, this love high hopes. The volunteers came to relieve those who were too tired. The brotherhood of hobos sent aid. Wow, yeah, someone connected a radio amplifier to the wire of floyd's light bowl.\n\nspk_0 : Now you can hear about how fucked we are.\n\nspk_1 : So what this would do is it it would detect vibrations when floyd moves so it crackled twenty times a minute and they realized this was because he was breathing\n\nspk_2 : okay so I have a baby monitor\n\nspk_1 : yeah they've made a baby monitor but okay so they got this crackle they know he's okay but progress is slow tuesday comes thursday tuesday a week and we consumption we could have ever being technically yeah on wednesday february eleventh hour two hundred eighty eight yeah man the rain turned to snow\n\nspk_2 : what I mean come on\n\nspk_1 : the mud froze okay floyd's light went out in many ways the shaft was at forty four feet\n\nspk_2 : god this really is I mean this is a race against time\n\nspk_1 : yeah floyd's dad lee ask for donations from people and then conspiracy theorists jumped in they flick claim floyd was not even trapped this was all about money oh wow you\n\nspk_0 : gotta have them it's fucking america\n\nspk_2 : is this gotta have a queue behind this\n\nspk_1 : the family newspapers railroads in cave city were all cashing in they said these newspapers ran out of things to report\n\nspk_0 : is that cave dummy\n\nspk_1 : and become a stagnant stories so they started just only that they started just preaching about not preaching just reporting about the the conspiracy theory right because there's nothing else to tell it's a guy in the hole is yeah but\n\nspk_2 : there's six feet away from proof which is the title of the story. Six feet away\n\nspk_1 : some people sent telegrams to floyd one came from kansas quote so from floyd off from floyd yeah there it's people trying to make it seem like conspiracy theories true quote please contradict statements that I am buried alive in san cave tell mother i'm alright coming home floyd collins\n\nspk_2 : I just there are so many similarities at times thank knows\n\nspk_1 : another rumor was that the collins family loving publicity's deliberately delayed floyd's rescue\n\nspk_2 : yeah, he just wanted to eat sausage down\n\nspk_1 : some said johnny had stopped rescuers from entering the cave because he worked in real estate and had a financial interest in crystal gave\n\nspk_2 : absolutely yeah, he doesn't want to buy the cave where a guy died\n\nspk_1 : it meant that if you know the other cave the cave they owned\n\nspk_2 : all right, all right.\n\nspk_1 : Johnny has a piece of floyd dies he's gonna benefit by getting that populated resentful welp also popularity double resentful john burton said johnny gerald was, quote guilty of nothing short of murder when johnny's the on ly motherfucker who did anything\n\nspk_2 : keep digging stop arguing\n\nspk_1 : the governor told general Denver heart to convene a military court of inquiry to look into the conspiracy theories.

Seven right, good, good resource management\n\nspk_0 : at one thirty\n\nspk_1 : p m on monday, february sixteenth, a chisel penetrated sand cave. They frantically widen the hole, and a rescuer flashed his light in. They had broken through the ten foot pit, the man eased into the cave and angus flashlight at floyd crickets scattered, so he's probably crickets. Okay, good protein, the man saw glimmer. It was floyd's gold, too, which was not moving at all. You know, the man said, shook his head and yelled, quote,\n\nspk_0 : dead! Anyhoo, what let's, get out here, that's!

Yeah, man, people are poor, they're trying to fucking make money and in this area where they're going to dio find a fucking cave, strike it rich, we'll be back there. Yeah, the federal government was aware this was becoming a problem. Lee collins, floyd's, dad sold the steak and crystal cave. Okay. That\n\nspk_0 : was an ollie sold. No, god damn it, no, what? Why your child? We agreed, allow dr henry\n\nspk_1 : thomas, a dentist, to exume display for floyd's body and dentist in a glass cupboard coffin inside crystal\n\nspk_2 : cave man. Oh, that's, what?\n\nspk_1 : I got ten thousand dollars. See that down there, yeah, so that's, where you'd go and check him out, yeah. The horrified collins family. You\n\nspk_2 : know what? I give you? Permission when I go? Yeah. You're allowed to put me on display and make money off.\n\nspk_1 : I love that. Alright, love that. Thank you, sam. I appreciate that. Actually, I want to be in the body farm. The horrified khan's family obviously wanted to stop people from looking at the embalmed body of quote.\n\nspk_2 : But daddy said you did it. Greatest cape dad wanted it with the rest of the family. Is like that. Seems rude. Insensitive.\n\nspk_1 : Um, congress authorized turning mammoth cave into a national park in nineteen. Forty one. One reasons was so the government could control who went underground. All these guys are going down there and dying, right? So they're buying up piece by piece, but they bought the big piece, and then they slowly went. Bought all the little caves. They're buying caves around the area. S o need to own. The land obviously is buying up. In nineteen sixty one, the government bought crystal kaye for two hundred eighty five thousand dollars. Okay, flight was still inside.\n\nspk_2 : Floyd was oh, god! Oh, my god! Oh, god.\n\nspk_1 : In nineteen sixty one, there is eventually public access to the cave was closed off in nineteen eighty nine floyd's body was buried in a baptist cemetery\n\nspk_2 : of right on time\n\nspk_1 : jesus christ man professional covers eventually cave er's professional cameras eventually confirmed floyd's hunch the caves in the region are all connected four hundred five miles of passageways the mammoth cave system is now the world's longest but one cave is isolated sand cave is still separate who in the eighties the cave entrance was permit we sealed with a steel gate bolted and welded shut to this day capers continued to explore the four hundred five plus mile mana system and find the letters f c scratched into the rocks wow that's crazy jesus what oh that is where the phrase get her done came from that's what we're the phrase get her done came from right right people don't know\n\nspk_2 : that wow what a what a little ride how\n\nspk_1 : do you feel about yourself\n\nspk_2 : ah good good that I should not complain on planes anymore\n\nspk_1 : do you feel like america is better or worse than it wass\n\nspk_2 : I think america is better than it was but in\n\nspk_1 : a race to be worse yes that is correct we are the winners losers of all winner and loser town\n\nspk_2 : now where they yeah or the winners who are like\n\nspk_0 : we'd never lose just the fact that we're the bad guy\n\nspk_2 : in an eighties movie\n\nspk_1 : why can't a man just die can't a man just just have a problem and die and not have that\n\nspk_2 : well you know like even when you talk about something like that like today right we wouldn't people wouldn't come there and sell hamburgers and stuff but it would be exploited in the other ways where the news would be there with the breaking news logo up the whole time\n\nspk_0 : what's the\n\nspk_1 : difference between the barbed wire and the two thousand people around it and so on hamburgers and watching on cnn\n\nspk_2 : yeah it's a sensation selling\n\nspk_1 : ad for sure it's all the same you're making money off of the guy's suffering uses making money off of suffering\n\nspk_2 : and that's that that is the thing that that we love now more than anything is like\n\nspk_1 : capitalism and the news don't work because you did not get the news if there's profit incentive you\n\nspk_0 : know what I was\n\nspk_1 : thinking you'd get something else you get hysteria you get nonsense but if it's not profit ized if they can legally not get ratings the news is the\n\nspk_0 : news\n\nspk_2 : a huge problem and what I was thinking the other day is like what you really need is we need somebody who is like like in charge of ordering our problems in charge of like just\n\nspk_0 : someone who's just like yeah I understand how\n\nspk_2 : upsetting that is but you know we need to save earth in order to solve palestine you know but\n\nspk_0 : then what I realized was we did have that it was the person who was the news anchor that person was like here are the six\n\nspk_2 : fucking things that air terrible years let's go and that's\n\nspk_0 : how you knew what mattered crunk crunk I\n\nspk_1 : would divorce devote an entire thirty minutes to one subject\n\nspk_0 : or and like dan rather than you know like a lot over the years\n\nspk_2 : it was like you had this kind of one or two people who would be like telling you what was important yeah like you're saying like cronkite would be like okay, you know the vietnam is such a huge story that's what we're going to talk about instead but now because there's so many voices it is that it's\n\nspk_0 : colette is that by reporting on\n\nspk_2 : the president's tweets if everyone in the media who felt like they were fed up of the behavior and like the treatment of the present stuff were just like we will no longer report to eat if they all agreed to do that what a huge leg that takes out the way that the people communicators stories\n\nspk_1 : about people taking off their scooters and santa monica electric scooters and put it where people getting mad that they're on lawns and stuff and so they're only stories of people throwing them in the water and setting them on fire and doing this stuff but I think that if they do that they should be made to watch a five minute video of the fires in northern california and the people dying from heat yeah all over the world and just have to watch that and go you sure you sure the scooters of the problem we\n\nspk_2 : need a lot of a lot of what I don't get clockwork orange dhe a fucking risk like we need to set up like open like united artists can answer to every you think a clockwork orange peoples gotta start clockwork orange\n\nspk_0 : how is it not a thing\n\nspk_2 : and here's how you do it you just set it up anywhere where there's those things where it's like put your business card in to win a cruise anybody throws their business card in there right there all clock were going absolutely right over that by the way there's some people listed right now are like\n\nspk_0 : how the hell\n\nspk_2 : did they make a guy getting trapped in a cave about trump\n\nspk_1 : oh everything's about trump sorry i'm sorry if you think that that we're being wrong and tying everything into trump but guess what she's fucked deal with it yeah honestly deal with\n\nspk_2 : well you know big boy a lot of times like when you're dealing with you know like ah a movement that is leading you towards fascists you have two options you can either tie a rope around it and try to drag it out or just take the shoe off take this you off on grease it up I think it'd be better to just take the shoe off\n\nspk_1 : just don't let everybody in the cave is the worst thing.\n\nspk_2 : And what we're doing right now is where the people on land arguing about how to get floyd out of the cave while he dies. That's, right person.\n\nspk_0 : All right, everybody having fun.\n\nspk_1 : Are you freaked out about the cave story? It is quite literally, my worst nightmare.\n\nspk_0 : By the way, I think it's,\n\nspk_1 : ticketmaster, that refuses to put up our picture, because the guy thinks that it's offensive, I think, it's, ticketmaster. Oh, yeah, we'll look ahead. I ticketmaster thinks it's offensive grow some balls to get master your offensive. Yeah, your existence,\n\nspk_2 : alright, alright, by cars.","speakerNames":["Dave Anthony","Gareth Reynolds","Wiz Floyd Collins"],"summary":"<p>Comedians Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds examine Kentucky Cave Wiz Floyd Collins</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dolloppodcast.com/tour-schedule.html\">Tour Dates</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.redbubble.com/people/mrfoz/collections/439251-the-dollop\"> Official Merch</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://the-dollop-sources.squarespace.com/eps-320349/\">Sources</a></p>"}}
